# Gender-Specific Recovery Benefits for Dip/Chew Products - Session Summary

## Date: January 6, 2025

### Overview
Extended the gender-specific recovery benefits system to include dip/chew (smokeless tobacco) products, with scientifically accurate benefits tailored for male and female users.

### Key Accomplishments

#### 1. Fixed "13 months" Bug
- **Issue**: At day 3, the "Complete Health Transformation" benefit showed "13 more months" instead of "12 more months"
- **Cause**: Using `Math.ceil(daysRemaining / 30)` which rounded up
- **Solution**: Implemented more accurate month calculation using 30.44 days per month average
- **Result**: Now correctly shows "12 more months" at day 3

#### 2. Implemented Dip/Chew Gender-Specific Benefits

##### Shared Benefits (9 total):
1. **Mouth Sores Heal** (1-2 weeks) - Oral lesions disappear
2. **Gum Tissue Recovers** (2-4 weeks) - No more recession or bleeding
3. **Taste Buds Regenerate** (1-2 weeks) - Food tastes amazing again
4. **50% Lower Oral Cancer Risk** (52 weeks) - Major cancer risk reduction
5. **Stronger, Whiter Teeth** (4-8 weeks) - No more staining
6. **Blood Pressure Normalizes** (2-4 weeks) - Cardiovascular improvement
7. **Pancreatic Cancer Risk Drops** (26-52 weeks) - Significant risk reduction

#### 3. Fixed "Tins Avoided" Display
- **Issue**: Dashboard showed "portions avoided" for dip/chew users
- **Solution**: Updated both `recoveryTrackingService.ts` and `DashboardScreen.tsx` to show "tins avoided"
- **Calculation**: Assumes ~5 portions per day = 1 tin

#### 4. Added Product Type Switching to Neural Test
- **Feature**: Added ability to switch between product types in developer tools
- **Options**: Cigarettes, Vape, Nicotine Pouches, Dip/Chew, Other
- **Benefit**: No need to go through onboarding to test different products
- **Also Added**: Gender switching (Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say)

#### 5. Fixed Body Systems Display
- **Issue**: Dip/chew only showed 4 body systems vs 4 for pouches (should show more since it's worse)
- **Solution**: Added "Addiction Recovery" as 5th system for dip/chew
- **Result**: Dip/chew now shows 5 recovering body systems:
  1. Brain & Nervous System
  2. Heart & Circulation
  3. Oral Health
  4. Jaw & Joint Health (renamed from "Jaw & TMJ")
  5. Addiction Recovery

#### 6. Improved TMJ Clarity
- **Issue**: "TMJ" medical acronym unclear to users
- **Solution**: Renamed to "Jaw & Joint Health" in UI
- **Description**: Updated to "Jaw muscle tension relief and joint healing from constant chewing"

### Technical Changes
