# Premium Avatar Hair Fix - June 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed issue where some premium avatars (Pearl Dancer, The Alchemist, Prismatic Soul, Void Walker) were displaying with no hair or very little hair.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Hair Probability Setting
- Added `hairProbability` to the DicebearOptions interface
- Set to 100% for premium avatars (mythic rarity) to ensure they always have hair
- Set to 80% for other avatars to maintain some variety

### 2. Updated Seed Modifiers
Updated seed modifiers for the problematic avatars to generate better hair results:

- **The Alchemist** (goldWarrior): `gold-warrior-v3` → `gold-warrior-v4-hair`
- **Prismatic Soul** (diamondChampion): `diamond-champion-v4` → `diamond-champion-v5-hair`
- **Void Walker** (cosmicHero): `cosmic-hero-v4` → `cosmic-hero-v5-hair`
- **Pearl Dancer** (pearlDancer): `pearl-dancer-v2` → `pearl-dancer-v3-hair`

## Technical Details
The DiceBear micah collection can sometimes generate avatars without hair based on the seed value. By:
1. Explicitly setting hairProbability to 100% for premium avatars
2. Changing the seed modifiers to force new generation patterns

We ensure that all premium avatars will display with their intended hair colors and styles.

## Result
All premium avatars now consistently display with proper hair, maintaining the diverse and attractive appearance intended for the premium collection.
