# Progress Screen Redesign Session Summary

## Date: January 2025

### Overview
Complete redesign of the Progress screen to create a unique recovery journey experience, distinct from the dashboard.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Conceptual Shift**
- Moved away from dashboard-style stats display
- Created a recovery journey timeline experience
- Focus on milestones and achievements rather than just metrics

#### 2. **Design Elements**

**Recovery Score (Top)**
- Large, animated percentage display
- Contextual messages based on progress level
- Clean, focused presentation

**Recovery Journey Timeline**
- Visual phase progression with 6 distinct phases:
  - Acute Withdrawal (Days 0-7)
  - Early Recovery (Days 8-30)
  - Neural Rewiring (Days 31-90)
  - Deep Healing (Days 91-180)
  - Long-term Recovery (Days 181-365)
  - Maintenance (Days 366+)
- Interactive phase indicators with icons
- Current phase card with details

**Milestones Section**
- Horizontal scrollable milestone cards
- Achievement-based progression system
- Locked/unlocked visual states
- 10 major milestones from Day 1 to Year 1

**System Recovery**
- 5 key body systems (reduced from 9 for clarity):
  - Dopamine System (Motivation & Reward)
  - Executive Control (Decision Making)
  - Heart Health (Energy & Vitality)
  - Lung Function (Breathing & Stamina)
  - Sleep Quality (Rest & Recovery)
- Expandable cards with progress bars
- Focus on impact rather than technical details

**Recovery Insights**
- Personalized insights card at bottom
- Scientific notes presented conversationally
- Feels like a coach providing guidance

### Technical Implementation

- Progressive disclosure pattern
- Clean component architecture
- Proper error handling

### Design Philosophy

- No dashboard element recycling

### User Experience Improvements
