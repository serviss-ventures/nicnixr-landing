### Key Components

#### DailyTipService
- **Interface**: `DailyTip` with comprehensive tip structure
- **Functions**: 
  - `getTodaysTip()`: Smart tip selection based on progress
  - `getTipById()`: Retrieve specific tips
  - `getAllTips()`: Access complete tip library
  - `hasViewedTodaysTip()` & `markTipAsViewed()`: View tracking (future enhancement)

#### DailyTipModal

- **Features**: Animated modal with fade transitions, category-specific styling, scientific sources display
- **Responsive**: Keyboard-aware scrolling and proper mobile optimization

#### NeuralNetworkDemo
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of brain healing and neuroplasticity
- **Animation**: Smooth particle movements representing neural connections
- **Styling**: Matches app's dark theme with purple accents

### Redux Integration
- Integrates with existing `progressSlice` to access `daysClean`
- Uses `selectProgressStats` selector for progress data
- No additional state management required

### Data Structure
```typescript
interface DailyTip {
  id: string;                    // Unique identifier
  title: string;                 // Tip headline
  content: string;               // Main motivational content
  scientificBasis: string;       // Research-backed explanation
  actionableAdvice: string;      // Practical steps users can take
  relevantDays: number[];        // Days when tip is most relevant
  category: Category;            // Visual and thematic grouping
