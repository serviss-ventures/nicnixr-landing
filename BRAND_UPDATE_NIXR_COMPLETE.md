## Files Still Containing "NicNixr" (Historical/Archive)
The following files contain historical references and were intentionally NOT updated:
- Session summaries and save points (historical documentation)
- CHANGELOG.md (historical record)
- CONTRIBUTING.md (needs manual review for GitHub URLs)
- GITHUB_SETUP.md (contains setup instructions that may need manual review)
- Various documentation files that reference the old name in a historical context

## Next Steps
1. Update any GitHub repository names from `nicnixr-*` to `nixr-*`
2. Update domain references if domains have been changed
3. Update any external service configurations (analytics, crash reporting, etc.)
4. Update app store listings when ready to publish

## Summary
The main application code and user-facing documentation now consistently uses "NixR" branding. Historical documentation has been preserved with the original "NicNixr" references for accuracy.
