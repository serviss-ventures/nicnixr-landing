# Custom Purchase Modal & Seasonal Avatar Fixes
## Date: June 6, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Seasonal Avatar Display**
   - Fixed: All 4 seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) were showing at once
   - Solution: Added filter to only show current season's avatar
   - Now only shows Summer Legend avatar for June

2. **Custom Purchase Modal Implementation**
   - Replaced native alerts that looked "like it's from the 1900s with unapproved emoji"
   - Created sleek custom modal with:
     - Dark gradient background (#1F2937 → #111827)
     - Ion icons throughout (no emojis)
     - Live countdown timer: DAYS : HRS : MIN : SEC
     - Avatar preview at 120px
     - Success state with green theme
     - Type indicators: Limited (flash/red), Seasonal (leaf/yellow), Premium (sparkles/pink)

3. **Modal Not Showing Issue**
   - Problem: Purchase modal wasn't showing when clicking premium/limited/seasonal avatars
   - Root cause: React Native doesn't handle multiple modals well when shown simultaneously
   - Solution: Close avatar modal before opening purchase modal with 300ms transition delay
   - Added "Test Purchase Modal" button for debugging

### Code Changes:

```typescript
// ProfileScreen.tsx - Seasonal Filter
{Object.entries(SEASONAL_AVATARS).filter(([_, styleConfig]) => {
  const currentSeason = getCurrentSeason();
  return styleConfig.limitedEdition.season === currentSeason;
}).map(([styleKey, styleConfig]) => {
```

```typescript
// Modal Transition Fix
setShowAvatarModal(false); // Close avatar modal first
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowPurchaseModal(true);
}, 300); // Small delay to ensure proper modal transition
```

### Testing:
1. **Red "Test Purchase Modal" button** - Opens purchase modal directly
2. **Purple "Test Avatar Modal" button** - Opens avatar selection modal
3. Click any premium/limited/seasonal avatar to see purchase modal
4. Modal will close avatar selection first, then open purchase modal

### Status:
- Seasonal filter: ✅ Fixed
- Custom purchase modal: ✅ Implemented
- Modal visibility issue: ✅ Fixed with transition delay
