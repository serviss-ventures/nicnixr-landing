# Dashboard UX Improvements - Health Score Enhancement

## 🎯 Problem Solved
**User Feedback**: "I have no idea what that 88% health score means... nothing happens when I click that"

The health score metric on the dashboard home page was confusing and non-interactive, leaving users wondering what the percentage represented and how it was calculated.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Interactive Health Info Modal
Created a comprehensive educational modal that explains:

#### **What the Score Means**
- **Current percentage** with clear explanation
- **Combines multiple recovery factors** toward complete freedom from nicotine
- **Overall progress indicator** rather than mysterious number

#### **Score Components Breakdown**
- 🧠 **Brain Recovery** - Dopamine pathway restoration percentage
- ⏰ **Time Factor** - Length of streak (X days clean)
- 💪 **Physical Health** - Lung function, circulation, body systems healing

#### **Score Range Explanations**

- **25-50%: Building Momentum** - Noticeable energy and breathing improvements
- **50-75%: Strong Progress** - Major health improvements, decreasing cravings
