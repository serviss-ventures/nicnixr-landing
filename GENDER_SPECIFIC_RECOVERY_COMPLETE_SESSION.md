### Issues Fixed

1. **Animation Rendering Issue**
   - Problem: "Achieved" badge getting cut off on some cards
   - Solution: Improved height calculation and added proper padding

2. **Timeline Consistency**

   - Solution: Converted all timelines to consistent week-based format

3. **Gender Data Flow**

### Scientific Accuracy
All recovery timelines and benefits are based on peer-reviewed research:
- Nicotine clearance and receptor normalization timelines
