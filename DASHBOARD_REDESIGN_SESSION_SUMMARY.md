# Dashboard Redesign Session Summary

## Date: January 6, 2025

### Overview
Redesigned the dashboard's "Quick Actions" section to be more user-friendly and intuitive for new users. Also redesigned the Daily Tip modal to match the dashboard aesthetic.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. **Renamed Section for Clarity**
- Changed from "Quick Actions" â†’ "Today's Recovery Tools"
- More descriptive and tells users exactly what these are and when to use them

#### 2. **Reorganized Layout**
- **Primary CTA**: "Daily Check-in" (was "Recovery Journal")
  - Added time estimate: "2 min â€¢ How are you feeling today?"
  - Changed icon from book to pencil (create action)
  - Made it the most prominent action

- **Support Tools Row**: Three equal-sized cards
  - "Get Guidance" (was "AI Coach") - "AI coach available 24/7"
  - "Your Plan" (was "My Plan") - "Week 1 activities"
  - "Today's Tip" - "Quick motivation"

#### 3. **Layout Improvements**
- Removed separate AICoachCard and RecoveryPlanCard components
- Reduced icon sizes from 36x36 to 32x32
- Adjusted padding and margins for better space utilization
- Set fixed height of 135px for all support tool cards
- All three cards now display consistently without text cutoff

#### 4. **Daily Tip Modal Redesign**
- **Removed all emojis** - No more ðŸ’¡, ðŸŒŸ, ðŸŽ‰, etc.
- **Updated color scheme**:
  - Changed from bright gradients to subtle rgba gradients
  - Background changed from #1A1A2E to gradient using `['#000000', '#0A0F1C']`
  - Border colors unified to rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08)
- **Consistent styling**:
  - Card backgrounds use rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4) like dashboard
  - Text colors use COLORS.text and COLORS.textSecondary
  - Spacing uses SPACING constants for consistency
- **Visual improvements**:
  - Larger close button (36x36) with rounded design
  - Removed colorful left borders on cards
  - Unified border styles across all elements

#### 5. **Red Notification Badge Fix**
- **Smart badge visibility**:
  - Added state tracking for whether today's tip has been viewed
  - Badge only shows when tip hasn't been viewed yet
  - Uses `hasViewedTodaysTip()` from dailyTipService
  - Badge automatically disappears after viewing the tip
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `tipViewed` state with useEffect to check on mount and when modal closes
  - Conditional rendering: `{!tipViewed && <View style={styles.tipBadge} />}`

### Technical Details
- Changes made to:
  - `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`
  - `mobile-app/src/components/common/DailyTipModal.tsx`
