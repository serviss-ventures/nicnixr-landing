# Tonight's Work Summary - January 11, 2025

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Fixed Profile Screen Crashes
- **Issue**: App was crashing when trying to open due to duplicate imports
- **Fixed**: 
  - Removed duplicate `SafeAreaView` import from 'react-native' (kept the one from 'react-native-safe-area-context')
  - Added missing `Animated` import from 'react-native'

### 2. Profile Edit Modal Improvements
- **Issue**: Keyboard was pushing up the Save/Discard buttons and covering the input fields
- **Fixed**:
  - Removed `KeyboardAvoidingView` to prevent buttons from moving with keyboard
  - Kept buttons fixed at bottom of modal
  - Removed "My Why" section as requested (kept only Name, Your Story, and Your Vibe)
  - Now users can use the keyboard's "Done" button without UI interference

### 3. Avatar Pricing Updates
- **Updated Pricing Hierarchy**:
  - Premium Collection: $4.99 - $9.99 (unchanged)
  - Seasonal Collection: $17.99 - $22.99 (increased from $14.99-$19.99)
  - Limited Drop Collection: $19.99 - $29.99 (unchanged)
- **Rationale**: Makes limited drops and seasonal avatars feel more exclusive to justify higher prices

## Files Modified
1. `mobile-app/src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
   - Fixed imports
   - Restructured edit modal
   - Removed My Why section
   
2. `mobile-app/src/components/common/DicebearAvatar.tsx`
   - Updated seasonal avatar prices
   - All avatars already using beautiful `micah` style

## What Still Needs Work
- Linter errors in DicebearAvatar.tsx (TypeScript type issues)
- Test the profile edit modal thoroughly on both iOS and Android
- Verify avatar purchase flow works with new pricing

## Next Steps
1. Commit all changes
2. Push to GitHub
3. Fix remaining linter errors in next session
