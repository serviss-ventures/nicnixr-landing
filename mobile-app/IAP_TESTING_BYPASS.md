# In-App Purchase (IAP) Testing Bypass

## What Was Done

To allow testing without payment setup, I've temporarily bypassed the IAP/subscription requirements:

### 1. **BlueprintRevealStep.tsx** (Final Onboarding Step)
- Commented out subscription service initialization
- Simulates successful subscription for testing
- Changed disclaimer text from pricing to "Your journey to freedom starts now"

### 2. **subscriptionService.ts**
- Made `initialize()` gracefully handle `E_IAP_NOT_AVAILABLE` error
- Added fallback in `startFreeTrial()` to return success when IAP not available
- Logs `[TEST MODE]` messages when running without IAP

## How It Works

When you complete onboarding:
1. The app skips the payment flow entirely
2. Simulates a successful subscription
3. Proceeds directly to the main app

## To Re-enable Payments Later

1. In `BlueprintRevealStep.tsx`, uncomment:
```typescript
await subscriptionService.initialize();
const result = await subscriptionService.startFreeTrial();
```

2. Remove the test bypass:
```typescript
// Remove this line:
const result = { success: true };
```

3. Update the disclaimer text back to pricing info if needed

## Testing Without IAP

The app will now:
- ✅ Complete onboarding without payment errors
- ✅ Log `[TEST MODE]` messages in console
- ✅ Allow full app access for testing
- ✅ Not attempt any real payment processing

## Production Checklist

Before going to production:
- [ ] Set up RevenueCat account
- [ ] Configure IAP products in App Store Connect
- [ ] Add RevenueCat API keys to environment
- [ ] Remove test bypasses from code
- [ ] Test real payment flow on TestFlight
