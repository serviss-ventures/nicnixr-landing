# Personalized Content System Implementation Session Summary

## 📅 Session Date: January 29, 2025

## 🎯 **Objective**
Implement a comprehensive personalized content system that makes daily tips and milestones relevant to each user's specific nicotine product type (cigarettes, vape, nicotine pouches, chew/dip, etc.) instead of showing generic content that may not apply to their recovery journey.

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
Users were receiving generic milestones and daily tips that weren't relevant to their specific nicotine product type:

### **Specific Problems**
- **Lung recovery milestones** shown to nicotine pouch users (who don't have lung damage)
- **Generic "units avoided"** instead of personalized "cigarettes avoided" or "pouches avoided"
- **Daily tips about tar and carbon monoxide** for users who vape or use pouches
- **One-size-fits-all recovery information** that didn't match user's actual experience
- **Missed opportunity for targeted motivation** based on product-specific benefits

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**
Created a comprehensive personalized content system that:
- ✅ **Tracks user's nicotine product type** from onboarding data
- ✅ **Personalizes milestones** based on relevant health benefits
- ✅ **Customizes daily tips** with product-specific content
- ✅ **Uses proper unit names** (cigarettes/pods/pouches vs generic "units")
- ✅ **Provides targeted motivation** based on user's specific recovery journey

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. Created Personalized Content Service**
**File:** `mobile-app/src/services/personalizedContentService.ts`

```typescript
// Core service that tracks user product type and personalizes content
export const getUserPersonalizedProfile = (): PersonalizedContent => {
  // Gets user's product type from onboarding data
  // Returns relevant health benefits, withdrawal symptoms, costs
}

export const getPersonalizedMilestones = (daysClean: number): PersonalizedMilestone[] => {
  // Returns milestones specific to user's product type
  // E.g., lung milestones for cigarettes, oral health for pouches
}

export const getPersonalizedUnitName = (amount?: number): string => {
  // Returns "cigarettes avoided" vs "pouches avoided"
}
```

### **2. Updated Daily Tip Service**
**Enhanced:** `mobile-app/src/services/dailyTipService.ts`

```typescript
// Added product-specific tips that complement generic ones
const getPersonalizedTips = (daysClean: number): DailyTip[] => {
  // Returns tips specific to user's product (cigarettes, vape, pouches, etc.)
}

// Updated main function to prioritize personalized tips
export const getTodaysTip = (): DailyTip => {
  // 1. Try personalized tip first
  // 2. Fallback to generic tips
}
```

### **3. Updated Profile Screen Milestones**
**Updated:** `mobile-app/src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`

```typescript
// Replaced hard-coded milestones with personalized ones
const milestones = useMemo(() => {
  const daysClean = stats?.daysClean || 0;
  return getPersonalizedMilestones(daysClean); // Now personalized!
}, [stats?.daysClean]);
```

### **4. Updated Dashboard Unit Names**
**Updated:** `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`

```typescript
// Added personalized unit names
const personalizedUnitName = getPersonalizedUnitName(stats?.unitsAvoided);
// Shows "cigarettes avoided" vs "pouches avoided"
```

## 🔍 **Data Flow & Logic**

### **1. Onboarding Data Capture**
```typescript
// NicotineProfileStep.tsx captures:
- Product ID (cigarettes, vape, zyn, chewing, other)
- Category (cigarettes, vape, chewing, patches, gum, other)  
- Daily amount (number)
- Cost information
```

### **2. Personalization Service**
```typescript
// personalizedContentService.ts processes:
- Maps product ID to standardized type
- Defines relevant health benefits per product
- Sets appropriate withdrawal symptoms
- Calculates cost savings multipliers
- Generates personalized milestones
```

### **3. Content Delivery**
```typescript
// Services deliver personalized content:
- Daily tips prioritize product-specific content
- Milestones show only relevant achievements
- Dashboard displays correct unit names
- All content matches user's actual experience
```
