# NicNixr v2.2.0 - Deployment Summary
*Completed: January 25, 2025*

## üéØ **CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED**

**Problem**: Users selecting different nicotine products (pouches, vape, chewing tobacco, etc.) were still seeing cigarette-specific content throughout the app, creating a poor and inaccurate user experience.

**Root Cause**: Multiple hardcoded "cigarettes" fallbacks in the codebase that ignored user's actual product selection.

**Impact**: This was a critical UX issue affecting the core value proposition of personalized health recovery.

## ‚úÖ **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### üîß **Code Fixes Applied**

#### 1. **ProgressScreen.tsx** - Product-Specific Health Metrics
- **FIXED**: Changed default fallback from `'cigarettes'` to `'other'`
- **ADDED**: Comprehensive product-specific health metrics:
  - **Cigarettes**: Lung capacity, circulation, taste/smell recovery
  - **Vape**: Lung function, oral health improvements
  - **Pouches**: Oral health, gum healing metrics
  - **Chewing**: Oral tissue recovery, reduced inflammation
  - **Other**: Generic addiction recovery metrics

#### 2. **BlueprintRevealStep.tsx** - Onboarding Completion
- **FIXED**: Removed hardcoded cigarettes fallback in completion flow
- **ENHANCED**: Proper nicotine product data validation
- **ADDED**: Comprehensive debugging logs for data flow tracking

#### 3. **NicotineProfileStep.tsx** - Product Selection
- **ADDED**: Debug logging to track user product selection
- **ENHANCED**: Data validation and error handling
- **IMPROVED**: User feedback during product selection process

#### 4. **AuthScreen.tsx** - Demo User Experience
- **FIXED**: Demo user no longer defaults to cigarettes
- **CHANGED**: Uses generic "Nicotine Product" for unbiased demo experience

#### 5. **CommunityScreen.tsx** - Icon Compatibility
- **FIXED**: Invalid icon name `chatbubble-outline` ‚Üí `chatbubbles-outline`

### üß™ **Enhanced Debug Tools**

#### New Testing Functions in `appReset.ts`:
```javascript
// Test different product experiences
appReset.testNicotineProduct("cigarettes")  // Cigarette experience
appReset.testNicotineProduct("vape")        // Vaping experience  
appReset.testNicotineProduct("pouches")     // Pouch experience
appReset.testNicotineProduct("chewing")     // Chewing tobacco experience
appReset.testNicotineProduct("other")       // Generic experience
```

Each function creates an authentic user experience with:
- Product-specific daily costs
- Appropriate harm levels
- Correct health metrics
- Proper terminology
