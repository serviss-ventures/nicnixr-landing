**Date**: December 30, 2024
**Time**: 8:30 PM PST
**Status**: ✅ All issues resolved

## Summary
Successfully fixed all layout issues in the Recovery Overview modal. The modal now displays properly with a clean 2x2 grid for Recovery Components, vertical stacked cards for Recovery Journey phases, and properly formatted Understanding Your Score section.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Recovery Components Grid - FIXED
**Problem**: Recovery component cards were displayed in a single horizontal line instead of a 2x2 grid, with inconsistent card sizes.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Removed `alignItems: 'center'` from `recoveryComponentsSection` 
- Added `width: '100%'` to `recoveryComponentsGrid`
- Set cards to `width: '48%'` for proper 2-column layout
- Added `marginBottom` for spacing between rows
- Fixed card height to exactly `180px` for all cards
- Set value text to fixed `height: 32` with `lineHeight: 32`
- Added `flex: 1` to gradient container
- Added `marginTop: 'auto'` to progress bars for consistent alignment

**Result**: All four cards now display in a perfect 2x2 grid with identical sizing.

### 2. ✅ Recovery Journey Phases - FIXED
**Problem**: Recovery phase cards were squished horizontally with 23% width each, causing text to be broken and unreadable.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed from horizontal row layout to vertical stack layout
- Set phase cards to `width: '100%'` 
- Removed `flexDirection: 'row'` from phases container
- Restructured phase header with icon and flex container for title/range
- Added proper spacing between cards with `marginBottom`
- Reduced font sizes for better readability

**Result**: All five recovery phases now display as full-width cards with readable text.

### 3. ✅ Recovery Phase Header Structure - FIXED
**Problem**: Phase title and range were not properly aligned after layout changes.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Wrapped title and range in a flex container
- Moved title above range for better hierarchy
- Icon stays on the left with proper spacing
- Used `flex: 1` for the text container

**Result**: Clean layout with icon on left, title and range stacked vertically.

### 4. ✅ Understanding Your Score Section - FIXED
**Problem**: Items were displayed horizontally with vertical dividers, making text cramped.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Changed from horizontal to vertical layout
- Updated dividers from vertical (1px width) to horizontal (1px height) lines
- Added proper spacing between items with `marginBottom`
- Fixed text alignment with `flex: 1` for proper wrapping
- Set last item to have no bottom margin

**Result**: Three items now stack vertically with clear horizontal dividers.

### 5. ✅ Card Size Consistency - FIXED
**Problem**: "Good" and "Clear" cards appeared slightly smaller than numeric value cards.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Fixed all cards to exactly 180px height
- Set value text to fixed height/lineHeight of 32px
- Used `justifyContent: 'space-between'` for even distribution
- Added `textAlign: 'center'` for consistent alignment

**Result**: All four Recovery Component cards are now exactly the same size.
