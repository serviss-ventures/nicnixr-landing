# Product-Specific Recovery Plans Update

## Summary
Fixed an issue where users who selected "Nicotine Pouches" (Zyn) were seeing cigarette-specific content in their recovery plans. The app now properly displays pouch-specific strategies and goals.

## Changes Made

### 1. RecoveryPlansScreen.tsx
- Added category mapping: `other` → `pouches` to handle nicotine pouches properly
- Added complete "pouches" category to all 5 recovery plans:
  - **Neural Rewiring**: Pouch-specific habit replacement strategies
  - **Craving Domination**: Oral fixation management techniques for pouch users
  - **Stress Mastery**: Pouch-free stress relief alternatives
  - **Identity Transformation**: Building pouch-free identity and confidence
  - **Social Confidence**: Social strategies without discrete pouch use

### 2. PlanDetailScreen.tsx
- Already had proper mapping in place (`other` → `pouches`)
- Contains detailed pouch-specific content for each plan

## Example Content Updates

### Before (Generic/Cigarette-focused):
- "Smoke Break Replacement: Every 2 hours at work, take a 5-minute walk outside"
- "The Redirect Response: When someone offers a smoke..."

### After (Pouch-specific):
- "Pouch-Free Stress Break: Every 2 hours, take a 5-minute walk or do desk stretches. Same routine, zero nicotine"
- "The Replacement Ritual: When you'd normally use a pouch, drink cold water or chew ice"

## Product Categories Supported
- **cigarettes**: Traditional cigarette-specific strategies
- **vape**: Vaping and e-cigarette focused content
- **chewing**: Dip and chewing tobacco strategies
- **pouches**: Nicotine pouches (Zyn, etc.) specific content
- **cigars**: Cigar-specific luxury/celebration alternatives

## Technical Implementation
The app maps the user's selected nicotine product category to the appropriate content:
- When user selects "Nicotine Pouches" → category is "other" → mapped to "pouches"
- Each recovery plan has specific goals and descriptions for each product category
- Content is dynamically selected based on the user's product type

## User Impact
- Users who quit nicotine pouches now see relevant, specific strategies
- No more confusion from seeing "smoke break" references when using pouches
- Better engagement and success rates due to personalized content
