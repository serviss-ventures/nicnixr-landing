# Custom Purchase Modal & Seasonal Avatar Fixes
## Date: June 6, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Seasonal Avatar Display**
   - Fixed: All 4 seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) were showing at once
   - Solution: Added filter to only show current season's avatar
   - Now only shows Summer Legend avatar for June

2. **Custom Purchase Modal Implementation**
   - Replaced native alerts that looked "like it's from the 1900s with unapproved emoji"
   - Created sleek custom modal with:
     - Dark gradient background (#1F2937 → #111827)
     - Ion icons throughout (no emojis)
     - Live countdown timer: DAYS : HRS : MIN : SEC
     - Avatar preview at 120px
     - Success state with green theme
     - Type indicators: Limited (flash/red), Seasonal (leaf/yellow), Premium (sparkles/pink)

3. **Modal Not Showing Issue**
   - Problem: Purchase modal wasn't showing when clicking premium/limited/seasonal avatars
   - Root cause: React Native doesn't handle multiple modals well when shown simultaneously
   - **Final Solution**: Smooth transition with 150ms delay (like journal entries)
   - Avatar modal closes first, then purchase modal opens smoothly
   - When closing purchase modal, avatar modal reopens automatically

### Code Changes:

```typescript
// ProfileScreen.tsx - Seasonal Filter
{Object.entries(SEASONAL_AVATARS).filter(([_, styleConfig]) => {
  const currentSeason = getCurrentSeason();
  return styleConfig.limitedEdition.season === currentSeason;
}).map(([styleKey, styleConfig]) => {
```

```typescript
// Smooth Modal Transition (like journal entries)
setShowAvatarModal(false);
setTimeout(() => {
  setShowPurchaseModal(true);
}, 150); // Shorter delay for smoother transition
```

### Final UX Flow:
1. User taps avatar to open avatar selection modal
2. User taps premium/limited/seasonal avatar
3. Avatar modal fades out smoothly
4. Purchase modal fades in after 150ms
5. Closing purchase modal reopens avatar selection
6. Feels like one continuous flow (like journal entries)

### Status:
- Seasonal filter: ✅ Fixed
- Custom purchase modal: ✅ Implemented
- Modal visibility issue: ✅ Fixed with smooth 150ms transition
