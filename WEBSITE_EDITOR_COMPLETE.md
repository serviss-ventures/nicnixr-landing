# Website Editor - Complete Documentation

## 🎉 All Sections Now Working!

We've fixed all the issues with the website editor. Every section now properly updates the website when you save changes.

## ✅ What's Been Fixed

### 1. **Navigation Settings** (FIXED!)
- **Sticky Header**: Now properly toggles between fixed and absolute positioning
- **Transparent on Top**: Controls whether nav has background at page top
- **Show Logo**: Actually hides/shows the NIXR logo

### 2. **All Content Sections** (WORKING!)
- Hero text and buttons
- Stats with proper line breaks
- All 6 feature cards with icons
- Testimonial quotes
- Final CTA section

### 3. **Save Functionality** (IMPROVED!)
- Console logging for debugging
- Error alerts if save fails
- 1-second delay for file writes
- Automatic iframe refresh

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run this from the project root:
./start-editor.sh
```

Then:
1. Go to http://localhost:3000 (admin dashboard)
2. Click "Marketing Website" → "Page Editor"
3. Edit any section and click "Save Changes"
4. Watch the preview update automatically!

## 📝 How Each Section Works

### Navigation Settings
Toggle switches that control:
- Whether header stays at top when scrolling
- Background transparency behavior
- NIXR logo visibility

### Hero Section
- **Headline**: The big bold statement
- **Subheadline**: Supporting text
- **Primary CTA**: Main button text (shows on all "Download" buttons)
- **Secondary CTA**: Secondary button text

### Stats Section
- **Title**: Use \n for line breaks (e.g., "Line 1\nLine 2")
- **Subtitle**: Description paragraph
- **Success Rate**: The percentage (e.g., "73%")
- **Description**: Text below the percentage

### Features Section
- **Section Title**: Overall heading
- **Each Feature Card**:
  - Icon: Use any emoji
  - Title: Feature name
  - Description: Feature details

### Testimonial Section
- **Quote**: The testimonial text (without quotes - they're added automatically)
- **Author**: Who said it

### CTA Section
- **Title**: Final call-to-action heading
- **Subtitle**: Supporting text

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Changes not saving?
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for "Saving content:" and "Save result:" logs

4. Make sure both servers are running

### Preview not updating?
