# Product-Specific Recovery Fix Session Summary

## Date: January 6, 2025

### Issue Identified
- User reported seeing cigarette-specific recovery benefits (like "Oxygen Levels Recover") when using nicotine pouches
- Debug logs showed `category: "other"` and `productType: null` for nicotine pouch users
- The Progress screen was defaulting to cigarette recovery timeline for unrecognized product types

### Root Cause
1. Legacy data issue: When nicotine pouches were initially implemented, they were categorized as "other" instead of "pouches"
2. The Progress screen was only checking the category field, not the actual product ID
3. This caused nicotine pouch users to see inappropriate recovery benefits

### Solution Implemented
We implemented a targeted fix that:

1. **Checks if the product name contains "pouch"** when the category is "other"
2. **Doesn't rely on specific brand names** like "zyn" which would be confusing
3. **Is temporary** - only handles the legacy data issue where pouches were categorized as "other"
4. **Won't interfere** with future product types since it only triggers when category is specifically "other"

### Code Changes

#### Progress Screen (`ProgressScreen.tsx`)
```typescript
// Generic approach without brand names:
const productName = userProfile?.nicotineProduct?.name?.toLowerCase() || '';

// If category is "other" but the product name indicates pouches, update the type
if (productType === 'other' && productName.includes('pouch')) {
  productType = 'pouches';
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach
1. **Brand-agnostic**: Doesn't hardcode specific brand names like "zyn"
2. **Clear intent**: Obviously a temporary fix for legacy data
3. **Safe**: Only activates for category "other", won't affect future product types
4. **Generic**: Works for any nicotine pouch product regardless of brand

### Testing Notes
- Users with nicotine pouches should now see:
  - "Nicotine Pouch Recovery" in the header
  - Pouch-specific benefits (taste recovery, gum health)
  - No lung/oxygen-related benefits
  - Gum Health in body systems instead of Lungs & Breathing

### Future Considerations
1. Consider migrating old user data to update category from "other" to "pouches"
2. Ensure new users selecting nicotine pouches get the correct category set
3. Add validation to prevent mismatched product IDs and categories
