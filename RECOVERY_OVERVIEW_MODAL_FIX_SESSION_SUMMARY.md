# Recovery Overview Modal Fix Session Summary

## Date: January 7, 2025

### Issue
The Overall Recovery modal (accessed by tapping "Overall Recovery" on the dashboard) had its header back button stuck behind the iPhone's clock/status bar on first load.

### Confusion & Clarification
- User was asking about the "Overall Recovery" modal
- I mistakenly edited the Recovery Journal modal instead
- Reverted the Recovery Journal changes and focused on the correct modal

### Root Cause
The `premiumModalHeader` styles only had standard padding and relied entirely on SafeAreaView to handle the status bar area. However, SafeAreaView sometimes doesn't apply insets properly in modals on first render.

### Solution Implemented
1. Added `useSafeAreaInsets` hook from react-native-safe-area-context
2. Used the hook to get device safe area insets in the HealthInfoModal component
3. Applied the top inset as additional padding to the header:
   ```jsx
   <View style={[styles.premiumModalHeader, { paddingTop: styles.premiumModalHeader.paddingTop + insets.top }]}>
   ```

### Key Changes
- **Before**: Header relied only on SafeAreaView edges
- **After**: Header has explicit padding that accounts for status bar height

### Result
The Overall Recovery modal header now displays correctly below the status bar on all devices, including on first load. The back button is always visible and accessible.

### Lessons Learned
- Always clarify which component the user is referring to before making changes
- SafeAreaView in modals can be unreliable - manual insets provide more control
- Test modal rendering on first load, not just subsequent opens

### Files Changed
- `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` (HealthInfoModal component)

### Testing Notes
- Minor re-rendering occurs when modal opens (normal React Native behavior)
- Header now properly positioned below status bar on all opens
- Gradient fills entire screen as expected
