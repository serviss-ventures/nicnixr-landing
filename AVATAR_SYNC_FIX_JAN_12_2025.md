# Avatar Sync Fix - January 12, 2025

## Issue
When selecting "The Alchemist" avatar in the Profile screen, posts in the Community feed were showing "Ember Rising" avatar instead. This was due to a synchronization issue between:
1. Local state (ProfileScreen)
2. AsyncStorage 
3. Redux state (used by CommunityScreen)

## Root Cause
The ProfileScreen was initializing `selectedAvatar` with a default value ('warrior') and not properly syncing with the user's actual selectedAvatar from Redux state. This caused:
- Avatar selection to save to AsyncStorage but not properly update Redux
- Community posts to use outdated/incorrect avatar data from Redux

## Fix Applied

### 1. ProfileScreen Initialization
- Changed avatar initialization to use Redux state first:
```typescript
const [selectedAvatar, setSelectedAvatar] = useState(
  user?.selectedAvatar || { type: 'dicebear', name: 'Recovery Warrior', style: 'warrior' }
);
```

### 2. Added Redux Sync
- Added useEffect to sync selectedAvatar when user data changes
- Modified loadSavedAvatar to sync AsyncStorage with Redux
- Updated handleSaveProfile to persist selectedAvatar to both AsyncStorage and Redux

### 3. Community Avatar Display
- Already fixed to use user's selectedAvatar from Redux state

## Immediate Fix (For Testing)
If your avatar is still showing incorrectly:

1. **Force Sync Method**:
   - Go to Profile tab
   - Tap "Edit Profile"
   - Don't change anything, just tap "Save Changes"
   - This will sync your current avatar to Redux

2. **Re-select Avatar Method**:
   - Go to Profile tab
   - Tap the camera icon on your avatar
   - Select "The Alchemist" again
   - This will properly save to all state stores

## Technical Details
The fix ensures proper data flow:
1. Avatar selection → Updates local state → Saves to AsyncStorage → Updates Redux
2. App startup → Loads from AsyncStorage → Syncs with Redux if needed
3. Community posts → Read from Redux user.selectedAvatar
