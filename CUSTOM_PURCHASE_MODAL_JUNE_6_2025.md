# Custom Purchase Modal & Seasonal Avatar Fixes
## Date: June 6, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Seasonal Avatar Display**
   - Fixed: All 4 seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) were showing at once
   - Solution: Added filter to only show current season's avatar
   - Now only shows Summer Legend avatar for June

2. **Custom Purchase Modal Implementation**
   - Replaced native alerts that looked "like it's from the 1900s with unapproved emoji"
   - Created sleek custom modal with:
     - Dark gradient background (#1F2937 → #111827)
     - Ion icons throughout (no emojis)
     - Live countdown timer: DAYS : HRS : MIN : SEC
     - Avatar preview at 120px
     - Success state with green theme
     - Type indicators: Limited (flash/red), Seasonal (leaf/yellow), Premium (sparkles/pink)

3. **Modal Not Showing Issue**
   - Problem: Purchase modal wasn't showing when clicking premium/limited/seasonal avatars
   - Root cause: React Native doesn't handle multiple modals well when shown simultaneously
   - Updated Solution: Show purchase modal as clean overlay (no closing/reopening)
   - Added z-index: 1000 to ensure proper layering

### Code Changes:

```typescript
// ProfileScreen.tsx - Seasonal Filter
{Object.entries(SEASONAL_AVATARS).filter(([_, styleConfig]) => {
  const currentSeason = getCurrentSeason();
  return styleConfig.limitedEdition.season === currentSeason;
}).map(([styleKey, styleConfig]) => {
```

```typescript
// Clean Overlay Implementation
setShowPurchaseModal(true); // Show purchase modal as overlay
// No longer closing avatar modal first!
```

### Final UX Flow:
1. User taps avatar to open avatar selection modal
2. User taps premium/limited/seasonal avatar
3. Purchase modal smoothly appears on top (clean overlay)
4. Avatar modal stays open in background
5. Closing purchase modal returns to avatar selection

### Status:
- Seasonal filter: ✅ Fixed
- Custom purchase modal: ✅ Implemented
- Modal visibility issue: ✅ Fixed with clean overlay approach
