# Code Quality Improvements - January 12, 2025

## Overview
Four major code quality improvements made to enhance maintainability and reduce noise in the codebase.

## 1. Removed Console.log Statements

### Files Cleaned:
- **CommunityScreen.tsx**
  - Removed debug logging for user data
  - Removed console.log for post sharing
  - Removed console.log for post creation with avatar data
  - Fixed error handling to remove unused error parameter

- **DashboardScreen.tsx**
  - Removed MoneySavedModal debug logging
  - Removed iOS Simulator debug logging
  - Removed commented-out console.logs for avoided display
  - Removed date update logging

- **ProgressScreen.tsx**
  - Removed extensive debug logging for:
    - User data
    - Gender information
    - Product type
    - Stats and days clean
    - Benefits count and details

### Impact:
- Cleaner console output in development
- Reduced performance overhead
- Better production readiness

## 2. Improved Type Safety

### QuitDateStep.tsx
- **Before**: `handleDateChange = (event: any, selectedDate?: Date)`
- **After**: `handleDateChange = (event: DateTimePickerEvent, selectedDate?: Date)`
- Added proper import for DateTimePickerEvent from '@react-native-community/datetimepicker'

### ProgressScreen.tsx
- **Before**: `SystemCard = ({ system, index }: { system: any; index: number })`
- **After**: Created proper `SystemData` interface:
  ```typescript
  interface SystemData {
    name: string;
    percentage: number;
    icon: string;
    color: string;
  }
  ```
- Updated SystemCard to use the typed interface

### Impact:
- Better type checking and IntelliSense support
- Reduced runtime errors
- Clearer code intent

## 3. Fixed Linter Errors

### CommunityScreen.tsx
- Fixed unused error parameter in catch block
- **Before**: `} catch (error) {`
- **After**: `} catch {`

### Impact:
- Clean linter output
- Follows best practices for error handling

## 4. Removed Unused Imports

### QuitDateStep.tsx
- Removed unused `import * as Haptics from 'expo-haptics'`
- This import was accidentally added during type improvements but never used

### Impact:
- Cleaner imports
- Smaller bundle size
- Better code clarity

## Summary

These improvements enhance code quality by:
1. **Reducing noise** - Removed 25+ console.log statements
2. **Improving type safety** - Replaced 2 'any' types with proper interfaces
3. **Following best practices** - Fixed linter warnings
4. **Cleaning imports** - Removed unused imports

The codebase is now cleaner, more maintainable, and production-ready. All functionality remains unchanged - these are purely code quality improvements.
