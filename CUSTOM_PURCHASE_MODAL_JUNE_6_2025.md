# Custom Purchase Modal & Seasonal Avatar Fixes
## Date: June 6, 2025

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Seasonal Avatar Display**
   - Fixed: All 4 seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) were showing at once
   - Solution: Added filter to only show current season's avatar
   - Now only shows Summer Legend avatar for June

2. **Custom Purchase Modal Implementation**
   - Replaced native alerts that looked "like it's from the 1900s with unapproved emoji"
   - Created sleek custom modal with:
     - Dark gradient background (#1F2937 → #111827)
     - Ion icons throughout (no emojis)
     - Live countdown timer: DAYS : HRS : MIN : SEC
     - Avatar preview at 120px
     - Success state with green theme
     - Type indicators: Limited (flash/red), Seasonal (leaf/yellow), Premium (sparkles/pink)

3. **Modal Not Showing Issue**
   - Added debug logging to troubleshoot
   - User reports "can't click into the avatar"
   - Debug logs added to:
     - Avatar button click handler
     - Purchase modal click handlers
     - Modal visibility states

### Code Changes:

```typescript
// ProfileScreen.tsx - Seasonal Filter
{Object.entries(SEASONAL_AVATARS).filter(([_, styleConfig]) => {
  const currentSeason = getCurrentSeason();
  return styleConfig.limitedEdition.season === currentSeason;
}).map(([styleKey, styleConfig]) => {
```

### Debug Commands:
- Reload app: CMD + R in simulator
- Check console for:
  - `🎯 Avatar button clicked!`
  - `🎯 Limited/Seasonal avatar clicked:`
  - `🔥 Modal State:`

### Status:
- Seasonal filter: ✅ Fixed
- Custom purchase modal: ✅ Implemented
- Modal visibility issue: 🔍 Debugging in progress
