# Recovery Overview Modal Fix Session Summary

## Date: January 7, 2025

### Issue
The Overall Recovery modal (accessed by tapping "Overall Recovery" on the dashboard) had its header back button stuck behind the iPhone's clock/status bar.

### Root Cause
The modal structure had the components in the wrong order:
- LinearGradient was the outer container
- SafeAreaView was inside the LinearGradient
- This prevented SafeAreaView from properly applying safe area insets

### Solution
Matched the structure to the working Recovery Journal modal:
1. SafeAreaView as the outer container
2. LinearGradient inside SafeAreaView
3. Header and content inside LinearGradient

### Code Changes
```jsx
// Before (broken):
<Modal>
  <LinearGradient>
    <SafeAreaView>
      <View style={styles.premiumModalHeader}>
        ...
      </View>
    </SafeAreaView>
  </LinearGradient>
</Modal>

// After (fixed):
<Modal>
  <SafeAreaView>
    <LinearGradient>
      <View style={styles.premiumModalHeader}>
        ...
      </View>
    </LinearGradient>
  </SafeAreaView>
</Modal>
```

### Result
The Overall Recovery modal header now displays correctly below the status bar, matching the behavior of the Recovery Journal modal. The back button is always visible and accessible.

### Important Note
The Recovery Journal component was NOT modified during this fix - only the Overall Recovery modal in DashboardScreen.tsx was updated.

### Key Learnings

1. **SafeAreaView Hierarchy**: For full-screen modals, SafeAreaView should be the outermost component after Modal
2. **Flex Styling**: Both SafeAreaView and LinearGradient need `flex: 1` for proper full-screen layout
3. **Consistency**: Using the same pattern across all modals ensures predictable behavior

### Files Changed
- `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` (HealthInfoModal component)

### Testing Notes
- Minor re-rendering occurs when modal opens (normal React Native behavior)
- Header now properly positioned below status bar on all opens
- Gradient fills entire screen as expected
