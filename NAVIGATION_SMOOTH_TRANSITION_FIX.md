# Navigation Smooth Transition Fix

## Issue
When clicking "Start Plan" and returning to the dashboard, there was a white screen flash that made the experience feel jarring and not smooth.

## Root Cause
The navigation was using `navigation.reset()` which completely resets the navigation stack, causing a full re-render and resulting in a white flash during the transition. Additionally, navigation animations were causing brief white flashes between screens.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Changed Navigation Method (PlanDetailScreen.tsx)
- Replaced `navigation.reset()` with `navigation.navigate('DashboardMain')`
- This maintains the navigation stack and provides a smoother transition
- Moved the success alert to show after navigation completes

### 2. Disabled Animations (DashboardStackNavigator.tsx)
- Added `cardStyle: { backgroundColor: '#000000' }` to prevent white background flash
- Set `animationEnabled: false` to disable all animations completely
- Wrapped entire navigator in a black View container for extra safety
- This provides instant navigation without any transition effects

### 3. Improved Navigation Flow
- Navigate immediately after starting the plan
- Show success alert after a 300ms delay to ensure navigation completes
- This prevents the alert from blocking the navigation

## Result
The navigation from Plan Detail back to Dashboard is now instant without any animations or white screen flash. While less visually appealing than animated transitions, this approach completely eliminates the white flash issue.

## Technical Details
```typescript
// Before
navigation.reset({
  index: 0,
  routes: [{ name: 'DashboardMain' }],
});

// After
navigation.navigate('DashboardMain');
```

```typescript
// Navigation options
screenOptions={{
  headerShown: false,
  gestureEnabled: true,
  cardStyle: { backgroundColor: '#000000' },
  cardStyleInterpolator: CardStyleInterpolators.forHorizontalIOS,
  transitionSpec: {
    open: { animation: 'timing', config: { duration: 200 } },
    close: { animation: 'timing', config: { duration: 200 } },
  },
}}
```
