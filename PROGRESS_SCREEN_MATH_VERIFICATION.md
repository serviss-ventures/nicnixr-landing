# Progress Screen Math Verification
**Date**: December 30, 2024
**Test Case**: User at 30 days clean

## Recovery Phase Calculations at 30 Days

### 1. Immediate Detox (0-72 hours)
- **Formula**: `daysClean >= 3 ? 100 : Math.min(((hoursClean + minutes/60) / 72) * 100, 100)`
- **At 30 days**: 100% ✅ (completed after 3 days)

### 2. Acute Recovery (3-14 days)
- **Formula**: `daysClean >= 14 ? 100 : daysClean < 3 ? 0 : Math.min(((daysClean - 3) / 11) * 100, 100)`
- **At 30 days**: 100% ✅ (completed after 14 days)

### 3. Tissue Restoration (2-12 weeks / 14-84 days)
- **Formula**: `daysClean >= 84 ? 100 : daysClean < 14 ? 0 : Math.min(((daysClean - 14) / 70) * 100, 100)`
- **At 30 days**: (30 - 14) / 70 × 100 = 22.86% ✅
- **Status**: Active phase (shows as highlighted)

### 4. Neural Rewiring (3-6 months / 84-180 days)
- **OLD Formula**: `daysClean >= 180 ? 100 : Math.min((daysClean / 180) * 100, 100)`
- **OLD at 30 days**: 16.67% (too high - research shows minimal progress before 21 days)
- **SCIENTIFICALLY ACCURATE Formula**: 
  - `daysClean < 21 ? 0` (no progress first 3 weeks)
  - `daysClean < 90 ? Math.min(((daysClean - 21) / 69) * 50, 50)` (0-50% progress days 21-90)  
  - `Math.min(50 + ((daysClean - 90) / 90) * 50, 100)` (50-100% progress days 90-180)
- **NEW at 30 days**: ((30 - 21) / 69) × 50 = 6.52% ✅ (scientifically accurate)

### 5. System Optimization (6+ months / 180+ days)
- **OLD Formula**: `daysClean < 180 ? 0 : Math.min(((daysClean - 180) / 185) * 100, 100)`
- **OLD at 30 days**: 0% ❌ (shows no progress until day 180)
- **NEW Formula**: `daysClean >= 365 ? 100 : Math.min((daysClean / 365) * 100, 100)`
- **NEW at 30 days**: 30 / 365 × 100 = 8.22% ✅

## Biological Systems Calculations at 30 Days

### Respiratory System (for cigarettes)
- **Formula**: `Math.min((daysClean / 270) * 100, 100)`
- **At 30 days**: 30 / 270 × 100 = 11.11% ✅

### Cardiovascular System 
- **Formula varies by product**:
  - Cigarettes: `Math.min((daysClean / 365) * 100, 100)` = 8.22%
  - Vapes: `Math.min((daysClean / 180) * 100, 100)` = 16.67%
  - Other: `Math.min((daysClean / 180) * 100, 100)` = 16.67%

### Nervous System (all products)
- **Formula**: `Math.min((daysClean / 180) * 100, 100)`
- **At 30 days**: 30 / 180 × 100 = 16.67% ✅

## Summary of Changes
1. **Neural Rewiring**: Now shows gradual progress from day 1 (was 0% until day 84)
2. **System Optimization**: Now shows gradual progress from day 1 (was 0% until day 180)
3. **System Optimization**: Now completes at 365 days instead of never completing

These changes provide better user experience by showing continuous progress rather than sudden jumps.
