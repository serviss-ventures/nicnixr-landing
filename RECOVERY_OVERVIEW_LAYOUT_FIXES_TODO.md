**Date**: December 30, 2024
**Time**: 8:00 PM PST

## Layout Issues Fixed

### 1. Recovery Components Grid
**Problem**: Recovery component cards were displayed in a single horizontal line instead of a 2x2 grid.

**Solution**:
- Removed `alignItems: 'center'` from `recoveryComponentsSection` 
- Added `width: '100%'` to `recoveryComponentsGrid`
- Removed `gap` property and added `marginBottom` to cards
- Ensured cards have `width: '48%'` for proper 2-column layout

### 2. Recovery Journey Phases
**Problem**: Recovery phase cards were squished horizontally with 23% width each, causing text to be broken and unreadable.

**Solution**:
- Changed from horizontal row layout to vertical stack layout
- Set phase cards to `width: '100%'` 
- Removed `flexDirection: 'row'` from phases container
- Restructured phase header to show icon, title, and range properly
- Added proper spacing between cards with `marginBottom`

### 3. Recovery Phase Header Structure
**Problem**: Phase title and range were not properly aligned after layout changes.

**Solution**:
- Wrapped title and range in a flex container
- Moved title above range for better hierarchy
- Icon stays on the left with proper spacing

### 4. Understanding Your Score Section
**Problem**: Items were displayed horizontally with vertical dividers, making text cramped.

**Solution**:
- Changed from horizontal to vertical layout
- Updated dividers from vertical to horizontal lines
- Added proper spacing between items
- Fixed text alignment and added flex: 1 for proper wrapping

### 5. Progress Bars
**Problem**: Mini progress bars in recovery components might overflow.

**Solution**:
- Added `width: '100%'` to ensure bars stay within card bounds
