# Navigation and Grammar Fixes - June 11, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Grammar Issue in Community Header
- **Problem**: When daysClean was 1, it displayed "1 days strong" instead of "1 day strong"
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to use singular "day" when daysClean equals 1
- **Location**: CommunityScreen.tsx subtitle

### 2. BuddyChat Navigation Bug
- **Problem**: When clicking Mike S. message notification → BuddyChat → Back button, the Community tab would get stuck showing the chat instead of the feed
- **Root Cause**: NotificationCenter was navigating incorrectly to 'Community' → 'BuddyChat' which confused the navigation state
- **Solution**: Changed navigation to:
  1. First navigate to Community tab with buddies section
  2. Then navigate to BuddyChat after a delay
  3. This ensures proper navigation stack

## Technical Details

### Grammar Fix
```typescript
// Before:
{stats?.daysClean || 0} days strong • Never alone

// After:
{stats?.daysClean || 0} {(stats?.daysClean || 0) === 1 ? 'day' : 'days'} strong • Never alone
```

### Navigation Fix
Changed from direct nested navigation to sequential navigation with proper delays to ensure the navigation state doesn't get confused.

## Result
- Grammar now correctly shows "1 day strong" on first day
- Navigation from notification → chat → back now properly returns to Community buddies tab
- Community tab no longer gets stuck showing the chat screen
