# Remove Auth Screen - Session Summary

## Date: June 11, 2025

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Navigation Flow
- Modified `RootNavigator.tsx` to skip authentication and go directly to onboarding
- New flow: New users → Onboarding → Main App
- Removed authentication check from initial route determination

#### 2. Updated BlueprintRevealStep
- Added user creation logic when completing onboarding
- User is created from onboarding data (name, nicotine product, quit date, etc.)
- Automatically sets user in auth state upon completion

#### 3. Removed Auth-Related Files
- Deleted `mobile-app/src/navigation/AuthNavigator.tsx`
- Deleted `mobile-app/src/screens/auth/AuthScreen.tsx`
- Deleted `mobile-app/src/screens/auth/` directory
- Deleted `mobile-app/src/screens/onboarding/OnboardingScreen.tsx` (unnecessary wrapper)

#### 4. Updated Type Definitions
- Removed `Auth: undefined` from `RootStackParamList` in `types/index.ts`

#### 5. Fixed Step 8 → Step 9 Navigation Issue
- Added workaround for Redux persist issue where `totalSteps` might be 8
- Automatically navigates to step 9 when stuck on step 8
- Cleaned up debug logs for production

### New User Flow
1. App launches → Loading screen
2. Check if onboarding is complete
3. If not complete → Show onboarding (starting at Step 1)
4. User completes all 9 onboarding steps
5. On final step, user data is created from onboarding responses
6. User is automatically authenticated
7. Navigate to main app

### Benefits
- Streamlined user experience - no separate sign-in step
- More typical mobile app flow
- User data is collected during onboarding instead of registration
- Seamless transition from onboarding to main app

### Technical Notes
- User ID is generated with timestamp: `user_${Date.now()}`
- Email defaults to generated email if not provided: `user_${Date.now()}@nixr.app`
- User is marked as anonymous if no email was provided
- All user preferences from onboarding are preserved
