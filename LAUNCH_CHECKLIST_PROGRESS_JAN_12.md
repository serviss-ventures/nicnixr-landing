## Summary

**5 Launch Checklist Items Completed!** ðŸŽ‰

These completions move us closer to launch by addressing critical legal, marketing, and communication requirements. The items I focused on were ones that could be completed independently without requiring technical implementation or external dependencies.

### Next High-Priority Items to Consider:
1. **App Store Screenshots** - Need actual app screens
2. **Production Environment Setup** - Requires Supabase configuration
3. **In-App Purchase Products** - Need to be created in App Store Connect
4. **SSL Certificates** - For production domains
5. **Support Email Setup** - support@nixr.com configuration

### Updated Progress:
- Previous: 7/60 tasks completed
- Now: **12/60 tasks completed** (20%)
- Estimated time saved: ~2-3 days of work

Great progress! ðŸš€
