# January 10 Evening Session Summary

## Work Completed

### 1. Profile Edit Modal Fixes
**Problem**: Edit modal was saving changes when clicking X, vibe pills were displaying jaggedly, save/discard buttons were hanging off bottom of screen

**Solutions**:
- Fixed state management to use temporary variables (tempDisplayName, tempBio, tempSelectedStyles)
- Adjusted pill layout to 31.5% width for clean 3-per-row display
- Increased bottom padding to 50px to prevent button cutoff
- Added useEffect hooks to sync Redux state with local state

### 2. Milestone-Based Avatar Badge System
**Problem**: Avatar badges were based on health score calculation rather than journey milestones

**Solutions**:
- Replaced health score logic with milestone-based badges
- Added epic long-term badges:
  - 2 Years: üíé Diamond (bright teal)
  - 5 Years: ü™ê Planet (bright purple)
  - 10 Years: ‚ôæÔ∏è Infinite (hot pink)
- Updated ProfileScreen journey section to show all 12 milestones
- Extended recovery phases: Mastery (1-2y), Legend (2-5y), Immortal (5+y)

### 3. Recovery Phase Fix
- Fixed "Freedom" showing at day 90 - now correctly shows "Major Recovery"  
- Day 90 and below now properly display "Major Recovery" phase
- Updated in both ProfileScreen and BuddyProfileScreen

### 4. Neural Test UI Enhancement
- Added long-term test options to the "Set Recovery Time" dialog
- Now includes Year 2, Year 5, and Year 10 options
- These options properly update all stats including hours, minutes, seconds, money saved, and units avoided
- Complements the console functions added earlier (neuralTest.year5(), neuralTest.year10())

### 5. Recovery Phase Consistency Fix
- **Problem**: Profile showed "Freedom" at day 120 but user was still at 81% health score (Major Recovery phase)
- **Issue**: Profile used day-based thresholds while dashboard used health score-based thresholds
- **Solution**: Updated profile to use health score for recovery phases:
  - Starting Out: < 10%
  - Early Progress: < 30%
  - Building Strength: < 60%
  - Major Recovery: < 85%
  - Freedom: >= 85%
- Now consistent with dashboard - both use scientific health score calculation

### 6. Money Saved Display Fix
- **Problem**: Numbers above $999 were wrapping to new lines (e.g., $5,475 had "5" dropping down)
- **Solution**: Added `numberOfLines={1}` and `adjustsFontSizeToFit` to prevent text wrapping
- **Additional**: Added `minWidth: 80` to statItem container for proper spacing

### 7. Avatar System Improvements
- **"Day -2" Bug Fix**: 
  - Problem: Purchased avatars showed "Day -2 Unlocked At" because of placeholder values
  - Solution: Added logic to only show unlock days for progress avatars (>0), show "Purchased Collection" for bought avatars
  
- **My Collection Section**:
  - Problem: Purchased avatars stayed in their original sections (Premium/Limited/Seasonal)
  - Solution: Added "My Collection" section at top of avatar modal showing all purchased avatars
  - Features: Gold border, star badge, "Limited Edition" or "Premium" tags
  
- **Avatar Descriptions**:
  - Problem: Generic descriptions didn't reflect unique DiceBear nature
  - Solution: Updated to more engaging descriptions:
    - "One-of-a-kind guardian, uniquely yours"
    - "Epic companion with mystical vibes"
    - "Shimmering with recovery power"
    - "Elite warrior, forever legendary"

### 8. Avatar UI Cleanup
- **Problem**: Limited Edition and Premium badges had the same gold color, frame was broken on limited avatars, text needed cleanup
- **Solutions**:
  - Different badge colors: Premium = Purple (#A78BFA), Limited = Red (#DC2626)
  - Fixed frame borders: Reduced from 2px to 1.5px, increased opacity for cleaner appearance
  - Improved text: Increased font size to 13px, added line height for better readability
  - Consistent border styling across all avatar types

## Known Issues
- Build failing due to space in folder name "NicNixr App" causing Xcode script issues
- Syntax error reported for KeyboardAvoidingView (appears to be false positive)

## Next Steps
- Consider renaming project folder to remove space
- Test all milestone badges with different day counts
- Verify recovery phases display correctly across all screens
- Implement real IAP integration when ready
- Add backend support for purchased avatars
- Implement community features with buddy avatars
