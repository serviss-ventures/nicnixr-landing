## üéØ Summary
While you were picking up the kids, I focused on launch-critical improvements to ensure NixR is ready for production. Here's everything I accomplished:

## 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Marketing Website CSS Issue

- Predictive analytics (revenue projections, risk analysis)
- Active intervention tracking
- Model performance monitoring
- Real-time status updates (refreshes every 5 seconds)

**Key Improvements**:
- Added tabs: Overview, Predictions, Interventions, Learning
- Live/Pause toggle for real-time updates
