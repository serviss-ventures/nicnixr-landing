## Next Steps

To connect this to your backend:

1. Replace mock data with real Supabase queries
2. Implement authentication (admin login)
3. Add real-time updates using Supabase subscriptions
4. Connect AI Coach metrics to your AI service
5. Implement user actions (ban, message, etc.)
6. Add export functionality
7. Set up role-based access control

## Design Philosophy

The admin dashboard follows the same minimalist, dark aesthetic as the NixR mobile app:
- Clean, uncluttered interface
- Subtle animations and transitions
- Focus on data visualization
- Glass morphism for depth
- High contrast for readability

This creates a cohesive experience across all NixR platforms while providing powerful tools for managing the recovery platform.
