# Milestone Icon Update - June 12, 2025

## Change
Updated the 1 month milestone icon from `medal` to `ribbon`.

## Reason
The medal icon looked like a scanner/barcode reader, which wasn't appropriate for celebrating a major achievement.

## New Icon
The `ribbon` icon looks like an award ribbon, which is more celebratory and fitting for the 1 month milestone.

## Files Modified
