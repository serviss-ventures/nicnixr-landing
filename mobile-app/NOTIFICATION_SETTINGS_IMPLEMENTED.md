# Notification Settings Implementation - June 12, 2025

## Overview
Fixed the notification settings screen to actually control which notifications are shown in the notification bell. Previously, the settings were just UI toggles with no effect.

## Changes Made

### 1. NotificationCenter.tsx
- Added filtering based on user's notification preferences
- Only shows notifications that match enabled settings
- Calculates filtered unread count

### 2. DashboardScreen.tsx
- Updated to calculate unread count based on filtered notifications
- Respects user's notification preferences for the bell badge

### 3. NotificationsScreen.tsx
- Added developer option to reset demo notifications (dev mode only)
- Settings now actually control what appears in notification feed

## How It Works

### Notification Type Mapping
- **Community Activity** setting controls:
  - Buddy requests
  - Buddy messages
  - Mentions (@username)
  
- **Health Milestones** setting controls:
  - Milestone achievements (1 day, 1 week, 1 month, etc.)

- **Daily Motivation** setting controls:
  - Daily tips (handled separately via Today's Tip modal)

- **Progress Updates** setting controls:
  - Future progress-related notifications

### Filtering Logic
```javascript
const filteredNotifications = allNotifications.filter(notification => {
  switch (notification.type) {
    case 'buddy-request':
    case 'buddy-message':
    case 'mention':
      return notificationSettings.communityActivity;
    case 'milestone':
      return notificationSettings.healthMilestones;
    default:
      return true; // System notifications always show
  }
});
```

## User Experience
1. User toggles settings in Profile → Settings → Notifications
2. Changes take effect immediately
3. Notification bell only shows unread count for enabled types
4. Notification center only displays enabled notification types

## Testing
In development mode:
1. Go to Profile → Settings → Notifications
2. Scroll to bottom for "Developer Options"
3. Tap "Reset Demo Notifications" to create fresh test notifications
4. Toggle settings on/off to see filtering in action
