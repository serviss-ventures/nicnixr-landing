# Community Feed Updates - January 2025

## Overview
Major updates to the community feed section including floating hearts redesign, profile navigation fixes, and UI improvements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Floating Hearts Redesign
- **Removed**: Teenage-style multiple scattered hearts
- **Added**: Sophisticated single heart with glass morphism effect
- **Features**:
  - Single elegant floating heart with blur effect
  - Ripple ring animation that expands outward
  - Subtle particle system (8 particles in circular pattern)
  - Purple gradient theme matching app design
  - Fixed React synthetic event issues

**Files Modified**:
- `mobile-app/src/components/common/FloatingHeart.tsx` - Complete rewrite
- `mobile-app/src/components/common/HeartParticles.tsx` - New file
- `mobile-app/src/screens/community/CommunityScreen.tsx` - Updated heart creation logic

### 2. Profile Navigation & Vibes Fix
- Fixed issue where current user's vibes weren't showing when viewing own profile
- Clarified vibe generation is ONLY for mock/demo users
- Real users will always show their actual saved data
- Added proper support for current user's actual:
  - Support styles (vibes)
  - Bio
  - Product type

**Key Change**: `handleProfileNavigation` now properly checks if viewing current user

### 3. Edit Profile UI Update
- Changed "Name" label to "Display Name"
- Updated helper text: "This is how you'll appear in the community. It will not affect your username."
- Clarifies display name vs username distinction for future backend implementation

### 4. Community Feed Product Tags
- Re-added product tags showing what users are quitting
- Positioned between author name and days clean
- Changed from "quit vaping" to just "vaping" (product type only)
- Purple theme with subtle styling
- Added to both feed posts and comment modal

**Visual Details**:
- Background: `rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.1)`
- Text color: `#8B5CF6`
- Font size: 11px
- Lowercase text transform

## Technical Notes

### React Event Handling Fix
Fixed "Cannot read properties of null (reading 'nativeEvent')" error by extracting coordinates before async operations:

```typescript
const { pageX = 0, pageY = 0 } = event.nativeEvent;
// Now safe to do async operations
await Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
```

### Mock Data vs Real Data
- Vibe generation only happens for demo users without buddy profiles
- In production with backend, every user has complete profile data
- Current user always shows their real saved data
- No fake data generation for real users

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Floating hearts animation works smoothly
- [x] No console errors when liking posts
- [x] Current user profile shows actual vibes
- [x] Product tags display correctly in feed
- [x] Display name edit shows proper helper text
- [x] Comment modal shows product tags

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
1. Ensure all users have `supportStyles` array in their profile
2. Include `authorProduct` field when fetching posts
3. Implement username system separate from display names
4. Remove mock data generation once backend is complete

## Files Changed Summary
1. `mobile-app/src/components/common/FloatingHeart.tsx`
2. `mobile-app/src/components/common/HeartParticles.tsx` (new)
3. `mobile-app/src/screens/community/CommunityScreen.tsx`
4. `mobile-app/src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`

## Notes
All changes maintain backward compatibility and are ready for production. The app is launch-ready with these improvements!
