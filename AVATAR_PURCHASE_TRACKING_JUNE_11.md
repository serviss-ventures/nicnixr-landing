# Avatar Purchase Tracking Improvement - June 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed issue where purchased avatars incorrectly showed "3 Days Together" regardless of when they were purchased. Now properly tracks purchase dates and shows accurate information.

## Problem
When users purchased a premium avatar, the avatar info modal would show the user's total days clean (e.g., "3 Days Together") instead of how long they've owned the avatar.

## Solution

### 1. Enhanced User Data Structure
Added `purchasedAvatarData` field to track purchase information:
```typescript
purchasedAvatarData?: {
  [styleKey: string]: {
    purchaseDate: string;
    price: string;
  };
};
```

### 2. Updated Purchase Logic
When an avatar is purchased, we now store:
- Purchase date (ISO string)
- Purchase price
- This data persists in AsyncStorage with the user data

### 3. Improved Avatar Info Display
For purchased avatars:
- Shows "New" on the day of purchase
- Shows actual days since purchase after that
- Label shows "Companion" for new purchases, "Days Together" afterwards

For non-purchased avatars:
- Continue showing days clean as "Days Together"
- Progress avatars show unlock requirements

## User Experience
- **Before**: "3 Days Together" (incorrect - shows total days clean)
- **After**: "New Companion" → "1 Day Together" → "2 Days Together" etc.

## Files Modified
- `/mobile-app/src/types/index.ts` - Added purchasedAvatarData to User interface
