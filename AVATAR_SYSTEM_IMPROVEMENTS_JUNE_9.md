# Avatar System Improvements - June 9, 2025

## Summary
Enhanced the avatar system with fixes, improved diversity, and premium rotation features.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Season Survivor Avatar
- **Issue**: Season Survivor (90-day milestone) had silver/gray hair that made it look bald
- **Fix**: Changed hair color to black (`['18181b', '27272a', '3f3f46']`)
- **Result**: Now looks properly styled with visible hair

### 2. Enhanced Starter Avatars
Redesigned the 5 free starter avatars for world-class appeal and diversity:

1. **Classic Hero** - Athletic tan skin, brown hair, blue shirt (mainstream masculine)
2. **Golden Hour** - Fair skin with blush, caramel blonde hair, gold shirt (mainstream feminine)  
3. **Night Rider** - Deep skin, black hair, black shirt (sophisticated style)
4. **Rose Gold** - Peachy fair skin, brunette hair, pink shirt (modern feminine)
5. **Urban Legend** - Medium olive skin, dark brown hair, mint shirt (intellectual vibe)

### 3. Improved Premium Avatars
- Enhanced all 15 premium avatars with more attractive features
- Better color combinations and expressions
- Improved diversity across skin tones, hair colors, and styles
- Fixed "Prismatic Soul" to be more appealing (black shirt, mahogany skin, honey blonde hair)

### 4. Premium Rotation System
- **Updated Start Date**: Now starts from today (June 9, 2025)
- **Clean 30-Day Cycles**: Rotates exactly every 30 days
- **Added Helper Functions**:
  - `getDaysUntilRotation()` - Returns days until next rotation
  - `getNextRotationDate()` - Returns the date of next rotation

### 5. Rotation Timer UI
Added a smooth timer to the Premium Collection section:
- Shows "New collection in X days"
- Orange/amber color scheme (#FB923C)
- Clock icon for clarity
- Subtle background container
- Updates automatically

## Visual Design
- Timer uses orange/amber colors to stand out without overpowering
- Rounded container with subtle background and border
- Positioned below the premium collection subtitle
- Low-key but informative design

## Technical Details
- Rotation calculation based on modulo 30 days from start date
- 3 rotation sets (0, 1, 2) cycling every 30 days
- Timer automatically calculates days remaining in current rotation

## Result
- Users now have attractive, diverse starter options
- Season Survivor no longer appears bald
- Premium collection feels fresh with clear rotation timing
- Overall avatar system is more polished and appealing
