# NixR Mobile App - Morning Testing Checklist

## ðŸŒ… Good Morning! Here's What to Test

### 1. **AI Recovery Coach** ðŸ¤–
**What we fixed overnight:**
- Removed all mock/test code
- Now saves messages to Supabase properly
- Session management working

**Test Steps:**
1. Open the app and navigate to AI Recovery Coach
2. Send a message like "I'm having cravings"
3. Wait for the AI response
4. Check Supabase:
   - Look in `ai_coach_sessions` table for a new session with your user_id
   - Look in `ai_coach_messages` table for both your message and the AI response
   - Verify sentiment analysis is populated (should be "negative" for cravings)
   - Check that topics array includes "cravings"

**What to Look For:**
```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor:
SELECT * FROM ai_coach_sessions 
WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID' 
ORDER BY started_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;

SELECT * FROM ai_coach_messages 
WHERE session_id = 'SESSION_ID_FROM_ABOVE' 
ORDER BY created_at;
```

### 2. **Navigation Error Fix** ðŸ§­
**What we fixed:**
- Simplified navigation typing to prevent hook errors
- Should no longer crash when opening AI Coach

**Test:**
- Simply click on AI Recovery Coach - it should open without errors

### 3. **Quick Supabase Health Check** âœ…

Run this query to see your integration status:
```sql
-- Check recent activity across all tables
SELECT 
  'users' as table_name, 
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(updated_at) as last_update
FROM users
WHERE updated_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'user_stats' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(date::timestamp) as last_update
FROM user_stats
WHERE date >= CURRENT_DATE - 1

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'ai_coach_messages' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(created_at) as last_update
FROM ai_coach_messages
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'

UNION ALL

SELECT 
  'journal_entries' as table_name,
  COUNT(*) as record_count,
  MAX(created_at) as last_update
FROM journal_entries
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';
```

### 4. **Environment Setup** ðŸ”§
**Action Needed:**
Add this to your `mobile-app/.env` file:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_URL=http://YOUR_ADMIN_DASHBOARD_URL:3001
```

Replace with your actual admin dashboard URL (not localhost for mobile testing).

### 5. **Full Feature Test** ðŸš€

Test each integration:

#### Profile Update:
1. Go to Profile
2. Change your display name or bio
3. Check `users` table in Supabase - should update immediately

#### Progress Tracking:
1. Your daily stats should auto-sync
2. Check `user_stats` table for today's date

#### Journal Entry:
1. Create a journal entry
2. Check `journal_entries` table - should appear even if offline

#### Onboarding (if testing with new user):
1. Complete onboarding
2. Check `onboarding_analytics` for step tracking
3. Check `user_onboarding_data` for saved responses

### 6. **Common Issues & Solutions** ðŸ”¨

**If AI Coach messages aren't saving:**
- Check if user is authenticated (not null)
- Verify session was created first
- Check browser console for network errors

**If you see "Network Error" in AI responses:**
- The fallback responses are working
- Need to configure EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_URL
- Admin dashboard needs to be running

**If navigation still shows errors:**
- Stop Expo (Ctrl+C)
- Run: `cd mobile-app && npx expo start -c`
- This clears all caches

### 7. **What Your Team Will Love** ðŸ’ª

Show them:
1. **AI Coach conversations persist** - Open chat, close app, reopen - messages are still there!
2. **Offline journal works** - Turn on airplane mode, create entry, turn off airplane mode - it syncs!
3. **Profile syncs across devices** - Change avatar on one device, see it on another
4. **Analytics dashboard** - Show them the onboarding funnel data in admin dashboard

### 8. **Production Readiness** ðŸŽ¯

Before launch, ensure:
- [ ] EXPO_PUBLIC_ADMIN_API_URL points to production
- [ ] All .env variables are set correctly
- [ ] Test with a fresh user (clear AsyncStorage)
- [ ] Verify anonymous user flow works
- [ ] Check RLS policies with different user types
