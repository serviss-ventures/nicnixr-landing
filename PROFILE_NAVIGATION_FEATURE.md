# Profile Navigation Feature

## Date: June 7, 2025

## Overview
Added comprehensive profile navigation functionality throughout the Community screen, allowing users to tap on avatars and @mentions to view user profiles.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Clickable Avatars**
All user avatars are now clickable and navigate to the user's profile:
- **In Posts**: Tap any post author's avatar to view their profile
- **In Comments**: Tap any commenter's avatar to view their profile
- **In Original Post (Comment Modal)**: The original post author's avatar is clickable

### 2. **Clickable @Mentions**
@mentions in comments are now interactive:
- Styled with purple color (#8B5CF6) and underline
- Tap any @mention to navigate to that user's profile
- Works with all name formats (@Sarah, @Sarah M., @Emma L.)

### 3. **Navigation Handler**
```typescript
const handleProfileNavigation = (userId: string, userName: string, userDaysClean: number) => {
  navigation.navigate('UserProfile', {
    userId,
    userName,
    userDaysClean
  });
};
```

## Visual Indicators
- **Avatars**: Touch opacity effect (0.7) for visual feedback
- **@Mentions**: Purple color with subtle underline to indicate clickability
- **Event Propagation**: Properly handled to prevent conflicts with post clicking

## User Experience
1. **Natural Discovery**: Users intuitively expect avatars and mentions to be clickable
2. **Consistent Behavior**: All avatars behave the same way throughout the app
3. **Visual Feedback**: Clear touch states help users understand the interaction
4. **Profile Context**: Navigation passes essential user data (ID, name, days clean)

## Technical Implementation
- Added `TouchableOpacity` wrappers around all `DicebearAvatar` components
- Updated `renderCommentContent` to make mentions interactive
- Proper event handling with `stopPropagation` where needed
- Consistent navigation parameters across all profile links

## Ready for Production âœ…
The profile navigation feature is fully implemented and tested. Users can now:
- Tap any avatar to view that user's profile
- Tap any @mention to view that user's profile
- Navigate seamlessly throughout the community

This creates a more connected and explorable community experience!
