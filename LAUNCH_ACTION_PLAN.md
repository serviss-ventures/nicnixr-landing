# üöÄ NixR Launch Action Plan - What We Can Do RIGHT NOW

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ 7/65 tasks completed (11%)
- üéØ Critical items blocking launch: 15
- ‚è±Ô∏è Realistic timeline: 7-10 days with focused effort

## Tasks We Can Complete TODAY (Let's Do This!)

### 1. App Store Screenshots (2 hours)
Since your app is running on the simulator, let's create screenshots:

```bash
# I'll help you take these screenshots right now:
1. Open iPhone 15 Pro Max simulator
2. Navigate to these screens:
   - Onboarding welcome
   - Dashboard with progress
   - AI Coach chat
   - Community feed
   - Profile/Avatar screen
3. Press Cmd+S to capture each
```

### 2. Fix Admin Dashboard Authentication (1 hour)
Your simple auth is blocking production. Let me implement proper Supabase auth:
- Replace cookie-based auth with Supabase Auth
- Keep it simple but secure
- Test with your existing admin user

### 3. Create Production Supabase Project (30 minutes)
Let's do this together:
1. Go to supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create new project "nixr-production"
3. I'll help you migrate the schema

### 4. Environment Variables Setup (15 minutes)
Create production .env files with all the right values

## What's ACTUALLY Blocking Launch
