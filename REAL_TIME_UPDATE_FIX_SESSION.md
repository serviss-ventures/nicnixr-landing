# Real-Time Update Fix Session Summary

## Issue
When using the neural test dev feature to jump to day 3, the money saved and tins avoided data doesn't update in real-time on the dashboard. User has to do a hard refresh to see the updated values.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Chew/Dip Data Storage Issue**: 
   - `dailyAmount` was being set to 1 instead of the actual tins per day value
   - In `authSlice.ts`, the `completeOnboarding` function was using `packagesPerDay` for all products instead of `dailyAmount` for chew/dip

2. **Neural Test Redux Integration**: 
   - The neural test was updating AsyncStorage but not properly triggering Redux state updates
   - Missing proper await on async dispatch actions

3. **UI Re-render Issue**:
   - Dashboard component wasn't re-rendering when Redux state updated

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Onboarding Data Storage
```typescript
// authSlice.ts - Added dailyAmount to user object
dailyAmount: onboardingData.dailyAmount || onboardingData.packagesPerDay || 10,

// Fixed userProfile creation to use dailyAmount for chew/dip
dailyAmount: onboardingData.dailyAmount || onboardingData.packagesPerDay || 10,
```

### 2. Enhanced Neural Test Redux Integration
```typescript
// neuralGrowthTest.ts - Added proper Redux updates
import { setQuitDate, setUserProfile } from '../store/slices/progressSlice';
import { updateUserData } from '../store/slices/authSlice';

// Added state logging before and after updates
console.log('ðŸ“Š Current progress state:', {...});

// Properly await all dispatch actions
const loadResult = await store.dispatch(loadStoredProgress());
const updateResult = await store.dispatch(updateProgress());
```

### 3. Added Dashboard Re-render Trigger
```typescript
// DashboardScreen.tsx - Added progressLastUpdated to force re-renders
const progressLastUpdated = useSelector((state: RootState) => state.progress.lastUpdated);

useEffect(() => {
  if (progressLastUpdated) {
    console.log('ðŸ“Š Progress updated at:', progressLastUpdated);
  }
}, [progressLastUpdated]);
```

### 4. Simplified Chew/Dip to Daily Units
- Changed from "tins per week" to "tins per day" in onboarding
- Updated all calculations to use daily tins consistently
- Fixed the avoided calculator to show proper conversions

## Testing Checklist

1. **Fresh Onboarding**:
   - [ ] Enter 0.7 tins/day for chew/dip
   - [ ] Verify dashboard shows correct calculations

2. **Neural Test**:
   - [ ] Run `neuralTest.day3()` in console
   - [ ] Check console logs for state updates
   - [ ] Verify UI updates immediately without refresh

3. **Avoided Calculator**:
   - [ ] Update daily portions
   - [ ] Verify immediate update in dashboard stats

## Current Status
Waiting for user to test if the real-time updates are working properly now.

## Next Steps if Still Not Working
1. Check if Redux persist is interfering with updates
2. Verify the selector is properly memoized
3. Consider adding a manual refresh trigger
4. Check if there's a React Native specific issue with state updates
