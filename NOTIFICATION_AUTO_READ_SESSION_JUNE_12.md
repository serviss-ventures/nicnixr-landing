# Notification Auto-Read Implementation Session
## June 12, 2025

### Summary
Implemented LinkedIn-style automatic notification read marking when users view the notification center.

### Previous State
- Users had to manually click "Mark all as read" button to clear notification count
- Bell icon count remained until manual action was taken

### Changes Made

#### NotificationCenter.tsx
1. **Added Auto-Read Effect**:
   ```typescript
   useEffect(() => {
     if (visible && unreadCount > 0) {
       const timer = setTimeout(() => {
         dispatch(markAllAsRead());
         dispatch(saveNotifications());
       }, 300);
       
       return () => clearTimeout(timer);
     }
   }, [visible, unreadCount, dispatch]);
   ```

2. **Removed Manual Button**:
   - Deleted "Mark all read" button from header
   - Removed associated styles (markAllButton, markAllText)
   - Cleaned up button click handler and Alert

### Behavior
- When notification center opens with unread notifications:
  - 300ms delay allows users to briefly see unread count
  - All notifications automatically marked as read
  - Bell icon count resets to 0
  - No user action required

### UX Pattern
- Matches LinkedIn's notification behavior exactly
- Viewing = acknowledging (no manual marking needed)
- Improves flow by removing extra step

### Git History
