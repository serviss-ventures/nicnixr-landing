# Recovery Overview Modal Fix Session Summary
## January 5, 2025

### Problem Statement
The Recovery Overview modal had a SafeAreaView rendering issue where the back button would appear behind the status bar/clock on first open, but would display correctly after refreshing. This was the same issue we previously fixed in the Recovery Journal modal.

### Root Cause
The modal structure had `LinearGradient` wrapping `SafeAreaView`, which causes React Native to incorrectly calculate safe area insets on initial render.

### Solution Applied
Restructured the modal hierarchy to match the working pattern from Recovery Journal:

#### Before (Broken Structure):
```jsx
<Modal>
  <LinearGradient>
    <SafeAreaView>
      {/* content */}
    </SafeAreaView>
  </LinearGradient>
</Modal>
```

#### After (Fixed Structure):
```jsx
<Modal>
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <LinearGradient style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      {/* content */}
    </LinearGradient>
  </SafeAreaView>
</Modal>
```

### Implementation Details

1. **First Attempt** (Incorrect):
   - Moved SafeAreaView inside LinearGradient
   - This made the issue worse - gradient didn't fill the screen

2. **Second Attempt** (Correct):
   - SafeAreaView wraps LinearGradient
   - Both components have `flex: 1` style
   - Matches the working Recovery Journal pattern

### Key Learnings

1. **SafeAreaView Hierarchy**: For full-screen modals, SafeAreaView should be the outermost component after Modal
2. **Flex Styling**: Both SafeAreaView and LinearGradient need `flex: 1` for proper full-screen layout
3. **Consistency**: Using the same pattern across all modals ensures predictable behavior

### Files Changed
- `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx` (HealthInfoModal component)

### Testing Notes
- Minor re-rendering occurs when modal opens (normal React Native behavior)
- Header now properly positioned below status bar on all opens
- Gradient fills entire screen as expected
