# Seasonal Timer and Code Cleanup - June 6, 2025

## New Features

### Enhanced Seasonal Collection Timer
Added a beautiful countdown timer to the Seasonal Collection section showing when the current season ends.

**Features:**
- Shows current season icon (snow/flower/sunny/leaf)
- Displays countdown in "Xd XXh XXm" format
- Shows which season is coming next
- Beautiful gradient background with subtle borders
- Responsive layout with season info on left, next season on right

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Calculate season end dates
const getSeasonEndDate = (): Date => {
  const now = new Date();
  const year = now.getFullYear();
  const month = now.getMonth() + 1;
  
  if (month >= 3 && month <= 5) {
    return new Date(year, 5, 0); // Spring ends May 31
  } else if (month >= 6 && month <= 8) {
    return new Date(year, 8, 0); // Summer ends August 31
  } else if (month >= 9 && month <= 11) {
    return new Date(year, 11, 0); // Fall ends November 30
  } else {
    const nextYear = month === 12 ? year + 1 : year;
    return new Date(nextYear, 2, 0); // Winter ends Feb 28/29
  }
};
```

### Timer Design Improvements
The seasonal timer improves on the Limited Drops timer with:
- **Better Visual Hierarchy**: Season name and countdown are more prominent
- **Next Season Preview**: Shows what's coming next to build anticipation
- **Cleaner Layout**: Horizontal design with clear separation
- **Subtle Styling**: Uses glassmorphism effect instead of harsh backgrounds
- **Better Typography**: Larger, bolder countdown numbers

## Code Cleanup

### Removed Console Logs
Cleaned up all development console.log statements:
- Avatar modal state logs
- Purchase modal state logs
- Limited avatar click logs
- Seasonal avatar click logs
- IAP initialization logs

### Performance Optimizations
- Timer only updates when avatar modal is visible (already implemented)
- Removed unnecessary console operations

## Visual Design

### Seasonal Timer Styles
```css
- Container: Full width with margin top
- Background: Subtle white gradient (8% to 3% opacity)
- Border: Thin white border at 8% opacity
- Left Section: Season icon + countdown info
- Right Section: Next season preview with divider
- Typography: 
  - Labels: 11px uppercase with letter spacing
  - Time: 18px extra bold in yellow
  - Next Season: 14px bold in green
```

## Result
- ✅ Beautiful seasonal countdown timer added
- ✅ Improved visual design over Limited Drops timer
- ✅ All console logs removed for production
- ✅ Clean, maintainable code
- ✅ Better user experience with season transitions

## Technical Notes
- Season dates are calculated dynamically based on current year
- Timer updates every second only when modal is visible
- Supports all four seasons with appropriate icons
- Handles year transitions correctly for winter season
