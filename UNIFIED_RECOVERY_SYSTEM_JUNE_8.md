# Unified Recovery System Implementation

## Date: June 8, 2025

## The Problem
We had multiple different progression systems that were confusing users:
1. **Badge System**: Based on days clean (7 days = flame, 30 days = lightning, 100 days = trophy)
2. **Recovery Stages**: Based on health score (Starting Out → Early Progress → Building Strength → Major Recovery → Freedom)
3. **Buddy Profile Stages**: Initially created new stages that didn't match the app
4. **Achievement Milestones**: Week Warrior, Month Champion, etc.

This inconsistency was creating confusion - users would see different progression indicators in different parts of the app.

## The Solution
Unified everything under the **Recovery Stage System** that's based on health score calculations:

### Single Recovery Journey
- **Starting Out** (0-3 days, <10% health score) - No badge yet
- **Early Progress** (3-14 days, 10-30% health score) - 📈 trending-up badge
- **Building Strength** (14-30 days, 30-60% health score) - 💪 barbell badge  
- **Major Recovery** (30-90 days, 60-85% health score) - 🛡️ shield-checkmark badge
- **Freedom** (90+ days, 85%+ health score) - ⭐ star badge

### Changes Made

1. **Updated Badge System** (`mobile-app/src/utils/badges.ts`)
   - Badges now reflect recovery stages instead of arbitrary day counts
   - Uses health score calculation to determine which badge to show
   - Colors match the recovery stage colors

2. **Fixed Buddy Profile** (`mobile-app/src/screens/community/BuddyProfileScreen.tsx`)
   - Uses proper Ionicons instead of emojis
   - Recovery stages match the main app system

3. **Removed Duplicate Systems**
   - No more separate achievement badge logic in DicebearAvatar
   - All badge logic centralized in badges.ts

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Same stages everywhere - dashboard, profiles, badges
2. **Clarity**: Users see one unified journey throughout the app
3. **Better UX**: No confusion about different progression systems
4. **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for recovery stages

## Technical Details

The health score is calculated from days clean using this approximation:
- 0-3 days: 0-10% health score
- 3-14 days: 10-30% health score
- 14-30 days: 30-60% health score
- 30-90 days: 60-85% health score
- 90+ days: 85-100% health score

This ensures badges align with the recovery phases shown in the dashboard.

## Visual Consistency

Now users will see:
- Same recovery stage names everywhere
- Same colors for each stage
- Same progression throughout their journey
- Badges that match their current recovery phase

## Files Modified
- `mobile-app/src/utils/badges.ts` - Unified badge system
- `mobile-app/src/components/common/DicebearAvatar.tsx` - Removed duplicate badge logic
- `mobile-app/src/screens/community/BuddyProfileScreen.tsx` - Fixed recovery stages
- `BADGE_SYSTEM_EXPLANATION.md` - Updated documentation

## Future Enhancements
- Add animations when transitioning between stages
- Create special effects for reaching new stages
- Add stage-specific challenges and rewards
- Consider premium badge customization options
