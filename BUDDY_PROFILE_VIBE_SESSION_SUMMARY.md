# Buddy Profile and Request Card Simplification Session

## Date: June 11, 2025

### Summary
Simplified buddy profiles and request cards based on user feedback to create a cleaner, more focused experience.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Buddy Profile Screen Updates
- **Removed**: "My Why" section showing reasons to quit
- **Added**: "Vibe" section showing support styles instead
- **Reasoning**: Users wanted to see how buddies offer support rather than their personal reasons

#### 2. Buddy Request Card Simplification
- **Before**: Showed name, day count, product, and support style
- **After**: Shows only name, day count ("Day X • Quit [product]"), and bio preview
- **Result**: Cleaner, less cluttered buddy request cards

#### 3. Styling Updates
- Changed vibe tags to use purple accent color (#8B5CF6) instead of green
- Maintains visual consistency with the buddy system's purple theme

### Technical Details
- Updated `BuddyProfileScreen.tsx`:
  - Replaced `whySection` with `vibeSection`
  - Changed styling from green to purple for vibe tags
  - Shows `supportStyles` array from profile data

- Updated `CommunityScreen.tsx`:
  - Simplified `compactBuddyStats` to remove support style
  - Shows format: "Day X • Quit [product]"
  - Kept bio preview for context

### User Experience Impact
- Buddy profiles now focus on how users support each other (vibe) rather than personal reasons
- Request cards are less overwhelming with just essential information
- Maintains enough context for users to make connection decisions
