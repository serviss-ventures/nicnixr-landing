# Notifications Feature Implementation - June 11, 2025

## Summary
Implemented a comprehensive notifications screen with three types of notifications:
1. **Buddy Requests** - Accept/decline buddy connection requests
2. **Buddy Messages** - View and respond to messages from buddies
3. **Milestone Achievements** - Celebrate recovery milestones and health benefits

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Created NotificationsScreen (`mobile-app/src/screens/settings/NotificationsScreen.tsx`)
- Beautiful dark theme UI matching the app's aesthetic
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Unread notification indicators with badge count
- Time-based grouping (Today/Earlier)
- Empty state when no notifications

### 2. Navigation Setup
- Created `ProfileStackNavigator` to handle profile-related navigation
- Added route from ProfileScreen â†’ NotificationsScreen
- Updated MainTabNavigator to use ProfileStackNavigator

### 3. Notification Types

#### Buddy Request Notifications
- Shows buddy avatar, name, and days clean
- Product tag (cigarettes, vaping, etc.)
- Accept (green) / Decline (red) action buttons
- Haptic feedback on interactions

#### Buddy Message Notifications
- Shows sender avatar and message preview
- Tap to navigate to buddy chat
- Unread indicator dot

#### Milestone Notifications
- Custom icons (trophy, heart, etc.) with colors
- Celebrates achievements like:
  - Days clean milestones (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
  - Health benefits unlocked
- Tap to view progress details

### 4. Features
- **Unread Management**: Automatically marks notifications as read
- **Smart Timestamps**: Shows relative time (5m ago, 2h ago, 1d ago)
- **Action Handling**: 
  - Accept/decline buddy requests with confirmations
  - Navigate to chat for messages
  - Navigate to progress for milestones
- **Refresh Control**: Pull down to refresh notifications

### 5. Demo Data
Currently populated with demo notifications to showcase functionality:
- 2 buddy requests (1 unread, 1 read)
- 2 buddy messages (1 unread, 1 read)
- 2 milestone notifications (both types)

## User Experience
1. User taps "Notifications" in Profile settings
2. Sees grouped notifications with unread count in header
3. Can interact with each notification type appropriately
4. Smooth animations and haptic feedback enhance the experience

## Next Steps
- Integrate with real notification service/backend
- Add push notification support
- Implement notification preferences/settings
- Add more notification types (daily tips, community mentions, etc.)
- Persist notification state in AsyncStorage or backend
