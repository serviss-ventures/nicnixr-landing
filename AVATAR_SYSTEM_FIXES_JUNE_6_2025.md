# Avatar System Fixes - June 6, 2025

## Issues Addressed

### 1. **Timer Readability**
- **Problem**: Timer in Limited Drops section was hard to read - too small and unclear format
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased font size from 12px to 16px
  - Changed format from `Xd XXh XXm XXs` to clearer `X DAYS : HH:MM:SS`
  - Enhanced container styling with better padding and spacing
  - Removed monospace font for better readability

### 2. **Icon Badge Positioning & Size**
- **Problem**: Icon badges were too big and positioned awkwardly
- **Solution**:
  - Reduced icon size from 14px to 12px
  - Adjusted position from top: -8, right: -8 to top: -6, right: -6
  - Reduced padding from 6px to 4px
  - Smaller border radius (10px instead of 14px)

### 3. **Console Log Spam**
- **Problem**: App was continuously logging dashboard stats every second
- **Solution**:
  - Commented out `recoveryTrackingService.logRecoveryData('Dashboard')` 
  - Commented out debug logs for avoided display calculations
  - Reduced console noise while maintaining debug capability

### 4. **TypeScript Error**
- **Fixed**: Navigation type error by properly casting navigation function

## Technical Changes

### ProfileScreen.tsx
```typescript
// Timer styling improvements
headerCountdownContainer: {
  gap: 8,                    // was 6
  marginTop: SPACING.md,     // was SPACING.sm  
  paddingHorizontal: 20,     // was 14
  paddingVertical: 10,       // was 6
  borderRadius: 24,          // was 20
},
headerCountdownText: {
  fontSize: 16,              // was 12
  fontWeight: '700',         // was '600'
  letterSpacing: 1,          // added
  // removed fontFamily
},

// Icon badge adjustments  
limitedIcon/premiumIcon: {
  top: -6,                   // was -8
  right: -6,                 // was -8
  backgroundColor: 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9)', // was 0.8
  borderRadius: 10,          // was 14
  padding: 4,                // was 6
}
```

### DashboardScreen.tsx
- Commented out repeated logging in `getRecoveryData()` function
- Commented out debug logs in `getAvoidedDisplay()` function  
- Fixed navigation TypeScript error

## Result
- ✅ Timer is now clearly readable with better formatting
- ✅ Icon badges are properly sized and positioned
- ✅ Console is no longer spammed with repeated logs
- ✅ App performance improved without constant re-renders
- ✅ TypeScript errors resolved

## Note on Founder Edition Frame
The user mentioned the Founder Edition frame might look broken. After investigation:

- The "frame" is actually just a gradient border using `limited` rarity colors (red to gold gradient)
- The Founder Edition avatar has both earrings and glasses enabled (100% probability)
- Uses dark burgundy hair colors and warm skin tones
- The `specialBadge` property is defined but not implemented in the rendering

If the visual appearance needs adjustment, we can:
1. Adjust the gradient colors for a more subtle look
2. Reduce accessory probability to avoid clutter
3. Modify the color scheme for better harmony
4. Implement the special badge feature if desired

The technical implementation is functioning correctly - this appears to be a visual design preference.
