## Problem Statement
User reported scrolling issues in Step 2 of onboarding:
- "Weird scroll when clicking cigarettes"
- "Awkward jump to text box to input amount"
- Poor user experience requiring scroll to see amount input

## Solution Implemented
Complete redesign of the nicotine profile step to eliminate scrolling with a seamless two-phase experience.

### Key Improvements:

1. **No Scrolling Required**
   - Everything fits on a single screen
   - Eliminated the need to scroll down to find amount input

2. **Seamless Transitions**
   - Smooth animated transition from product selection to amount input
   - Products fade to 30% opacity when amount input appears
   - Selected product scales down slightly for focus

3. **Compact Product Grid**
   - Changed from 2x3 grid to 3x2 grid
   - Smaller product cards (30% width instead of 48%)
   - Reduced icon size (24px instead of 28px)
   - Removed product descriptions to save space

4. **Interactive Product Display**
   - Selected product shows prominently with larger icon (80x80)
   - "Tap to change" hint under selected product
   - Can tap selected product to go back to selection

5. **Prominent Amount Input**
   - Large number input (32px font size)
   - Auto-focuses when shown
   - Clear unit labels (per day/per week)
   - Contextual helper text for each product type

6. **Smart Layout**
   - Amount input overlays the product grid
   - No scrollview needed - fixed positioning
   - Proper KeyboardAvoidingView for iOS/Android

### User Flow:
1. See all 5 nicotine products in compact grid
2. Tap product â†’ smooth transition animation
3. Products fade, selected product shows with amount input
4. Enter amount with large, focused input
5. Can tap product icon to change selection

### Technical Details:
- Used Animated API for smooth transitions
- Removed ScrollView completely
- Fixed positioning with overlay for amount input
- Maintained all product options (cigarettes, vape, pouches, dip, other)

### Result:
