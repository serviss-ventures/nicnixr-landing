# Progress Screen Math Fix - December 30, 2024
**Issue**: Recovery phases showing 0% progress when they first become active

## Problem Found
At exactly 3 days clean:
- Acute Recovery was showing 0% (calculated as (3-3)/11 = 0)
- Phase was marked "active" but showed no progress - confusing!

## Solution Applied
Added `Math.max(1, ...)` to ensure phases show at least 1% when they start.

## Verified Math at Key Milestones

### Day 3 (User's Current State):
1. **Immediate Detox**: 100% ✅ (completed)
2. **Acute Recovery**: 1% ✅ (just started, shows minimal progress)
3. **Tissue Restoration**: 0% ✅ (hasn't started yet - begins day 14)
4. **Neural Rewiring**: 0% ✅ (minimal progress until day 21)
5. **System Optimization**: 0.82% ≈ 1% ✅ (3/365 = 0.82%)

### Day 14:
1. **Immediate Detox**: 100% (completed)
2. **Acute Recovery**: 100% (completed)
3. **Tissue Restoration**: 1% (just started)
4. **Neural Rewiring**: 0% (starts day 21)
5. **System Optimization**: 3.8% (14/365)

### Day 21:
1. **Immediate Detox**: 100% (completed)
2. **Acute Recovery**: 100% (completed)  
3. **Tissue Restoration**: 10% ((21-14)/70)
4. **Neural Rewiring**: 0% (minimal at start per research)
5. **System Optimization**: 5.8% (21/365)

### Day 90:
1. **Immediate Detox**: 100% (completed)
2. **Acute Recovery**: 100% (completed)
3. **Tissue Restoration**: 100% (completed at day 84)
4. **Neural Rewiring**: 50% (halfway point in rewiring)
5. **System Optimization**: 24.7% (90/365)

## Updated Formulas

### Acute Recovery (Days 3-14):
```typescript
progress: daysClean >= 14 ? 100 : 
          daysClean < 3 ? 0 : 
          Math.max(1, Math.min(((daysClean - 3) / 11) * 100, 100))
```

### Tissue Restoration (Days 14-84):
```typescript
progress: daysClean >= 84 ? 100 : 
          daysClean < 14 ? 0 : 
          Math.max(1, Math.min(((daysClean - 14) / 70) * 100, 100))
```

### Neural Rewiring (Days 21-180):
```typescript
progress: daysClean >= 180 ? 100 : 
          daysClean < 21 ? 0 :
          daysClean < 90 ? Math.min(((daysClean - 21) / 69) * 50, 50) :
          Math.min(50 + ((daysClean - 90) / 90) * 50, 100)
```

### System Optimization (Day 1+):
```typescript
progress: daysClean >= 365 ? 100 : 
          Math.min((daysClean / 365) * 100, 100)
```

## Result
Now when phases become active, they show at least 1% progress to indicate they've started, providing better visual feedback to users about their recovery journey.
