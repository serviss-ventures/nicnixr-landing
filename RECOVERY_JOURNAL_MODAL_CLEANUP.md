### Technical Details

The modal now follows the same pattern as MoneySavedModal:
```jsx
<Modal
  visible={visible}
  animationType="slide"
  presentationStyle={Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'formSheet' : 'pageSheet'}
  onRequestClose={onClose}
>
```

### Result
The Recovery Journal now has a clean, consistent appearance that matches other modals in the app while maintaining all its original functionality for tracking recovery metrics.
