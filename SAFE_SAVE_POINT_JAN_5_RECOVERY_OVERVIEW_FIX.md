# Safe Save Point - January 5, 2025
## Recovery Overview Modal Fix & Neural Map Optimizations

### Session Summary
Fixed the Recovery Overview modal SafeAreaView issue and completed neural map optimizations for app launch readiness.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Recovery Overview Modal Fix
- **Issue**: Back button appeared behind status bar/clock on first open
- **Solution**: Restructured modal hierarchy to match working Recovery Journal pattern
- **Structure**: `Modal > SafeAreaView > LinearGradient` (not `Modal > LinearGradient > SafeAreaView`)
- **Result**: Modal now displays correctly with proper safe area handling

#### 2. Neural Map Optimizations (from previous session)
- **Performance**: Reduced particles by 35% (from ~170 to ~110)
- **Animations**: Simplified to use refs instead of state, removed complex math operations
- **Text Visibility**: Added dark backdrop for "Days Free" text with better contrast
- **Early Days Feedback**: Adjusted activation thresholds for better visual progression
- **Scientific Accuracy**: Updated dopamine recovery timeline (90% by 90 days, 95% by 6 months, 98% by 1 year)
- **UI Cleanup**: Removed redundant pathway recovery percentage badge

#### 3. Dashboard Copy Update
- **New Copy**: "Neural pathways rebuilding • Growing stronger / Watch your mind reclaim its freedom"
- **Improvements**: More concise, emotionally resonant, no redundant information
- **Style**: Center-aligned with better spacing and letter spacing

### Technical Details

#### Modal Structure Fix
```jsx
// Before (broken):
<Modal>
  <LinearGradient>
    <SafeAreaView>

// After (working):
<Modal>
  <SafeAreaView style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    <LinearGradient style={{ flex: 1 }}>
```

#### Files Modified
1. `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`
   - Recovery Overview modal structure fix
   - Dashboard copy update
   - Removed neuralBadgeMessage references

2. `mobile-app/src/components/common/EnhancedNeuralNetwork.tsx`
   - Performance optimizations
   - Visual improvements

3. `mobile-app/src/services/recoveryTrackingService.ts`
