- **Plan Recommendations** - AI-powered plan matching based on journal data

### 🏗️ **INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS**

3. **Personalized Content** - Some missing services but core tips working
4. **Missing Files:** BrandSplash.tsx deleted (may be needed)

## 🚨 **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

- **DO** test server startup after any changes (`npx expo start --clear`)
- **DO** verify all key files exist before making major changes

## 🔗 **QUICK START COMMANDS**
```bash
cd mobile-app
npx expo start --clear  # Start development server
git log --oneline -5    # Review recent commits  
ls src/screens/dashboard/ | grep -E "(AI|Recovery)" # Verify features
```
