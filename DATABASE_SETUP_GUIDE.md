## Quick Verification

After running the SQL files, verify everything worked:

```sql
-- Check all tables were created
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

You should see 13 tables!

## Test It Out

Create a test user to make sure everything works:

```sql
-- Create a test user (use the UUID from Supabase Auth)
INSERT INTO public.users (
  id, 
  email, 
  username, 
  substance_type, 
  quit_date
) VALUES (
  'YOUR-AUTH-USER-UUID', -- Get this from Authentication tab
  'test@example.com',
  'testuser',
  'cigarettes',
  NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
);
```

## What Each Table Stores

### users
- Profile info (username, avatar)
- Recovery data (quit date, days clean, streaks)
- Preferences (support styles, notifications)

### journal_entries
- Daily mood (yes/no)
- Craving intensity (1-10)
- Sleep quality & hours
- Energy levels
- Gratitude notes
- And 20+ other wellness metrics!

### ai_coach_messages

- Sentiment analysis (positive/negative/crisis)
- Topics discussed (cravings, stress, etc.)
- Risk levels for intervention

### community_posts

## Next Steps

Once tables are created:
1. âœ… Set up authentication in Supabase
2. âœ… Remove test bypasses in code
3. âœ… Configure storage for avatars
4. âœ… Test with real user accounts
5. âœ… Deploy to production!

## Need Help?

- **Tables not showing?** Make sure you're in the right Supabase project
- **Errors running SQL?** The tables might already exist (that's OK!)
- **Want to start fresh?** Drop all tables first (be careful!)

```sql
-- DANGER: This deletes everything!
DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
CREATE SCHEMA public;
```
