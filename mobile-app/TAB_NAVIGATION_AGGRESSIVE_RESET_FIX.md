# Enhanced Tab Navigation Reset Fix - June 12, 2025

## Problem
After navigating to BuddyChat from a notification, the Community tab would toggle between BuddyChat and CommunityMain screens when tapped repeatedly, instead of always showing the main screen.

## Root Cause
The previous `navigation.navigate()` approach wasn't fully resetting the navigation stack. React Navigation was maintaining the screen history, causing the tab to show whatever screen was previously active.

## Solution
Changed from `navigation.navigate()` to `navigation.reset()` with explicit stack state:

```javascript
// Before - Soft navigation
navigation.navigate('Community', {
  screen: 'CommunityMain',
  params: undefined
});

// After - Hard reset
e.preventDefault(); // Prevent default tab behavior
navigation.reset({
  index: 0,
  routes: [{
    name: 'Community',
    state: {
      routes: [{
        name: 'CommunityMain',
        params: undefined
      }]
    }
  }]
});
```

## Key Changes
1. **preventDefault()**: Stops React Navigation's default tab press behavior
2. **navigation.reset()**: Completely replaces the navigation state
3. **Explicit state structure**: Defines exactly what the stack should look like

## Benefits
- Tab icons now ALWAYS take you to the main screen of that section
- No more toggling between screens
- Consistent behavior across all tabs
- Clean navigation state after each tab press

## Applied To
- Dashboard Tab
- Community Tab  
- Profile Tab

Progress tab doesn't need this as it's a single screen, not a stack navigator.
