## Current App Status

### Running State
- App is running on port 8086 via Expo
- Access via: `cd mobile-app && npx expo start --clear`
- Metro bundler active and serving the app
- No current errors or warnings

### File Structure
- Main app code in `/mobile-app/` directory
- Step 7 component at: `mobile-app/src/screens/onboarding/steps/DataAnalysisStep.tsx`
- All session summaries and documentation in root directory

### Known Issues
- When running from root directory, expo can't find the project
- Must run from `mobile-app` directory
- Some ports (8081, 8084) may be occupied from previous sessions

## How to Resume Development

### Starting the App:
```bash
cd mobile-app
npx expo start --clear
```

### If Port Issues:
- Accept the prompt to use a different port
- Or kill existing processes: `lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9`

### Current Focus Areas:
1. Step 7 redesign is COMPLETE ✓
2. All 8 onboarding steps should now have consistent design
3. App is ready for testing the full onboarding flow

## Important Notes
- Step 7 now matches the elevated design of steps 1-6
- No medical/clinical language remains
- All emojis have been removed
- Professional, modern interface throughout
- "Start Your Journey" button is accessible and prominent

## Next Potential Tasks (When You Return):
1. Test complete onboarding flow (steps 1-8)
2. Review any other screens that might need design consistency updates
3. Consider implementing any pending features from the backlog
4. Performance optimization if needed

## Session Summary
Today's session successfully completed the Step 7 redesign, bringing it in line with the app's modern, professional aesthetic. The medical/clinical language has been replaced with friendly, encouraging messaging, and all visual elements now match the elevated design system used throughout the app.

The app is stable, running well, and ready for continued development when you return!
