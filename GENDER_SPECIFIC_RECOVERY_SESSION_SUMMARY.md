# Gender-Specific Recovery Benefits Implementation Session

## Session Overview
Implemented a comprehensive gender-specific recovery benefits system for the NixR app, starting with nicotine pouches as the pilot product type.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Data Model Updates
- Added `gender` field to `OnboardingData` interface
- Added `gender` field to `User` interface
- Both support: 'male' | 'female' | 'non-binary' | 'prefer-not-to-say'

### 2. New Service: genderSpecificRecoveryService.ts
Created a comprehensive service that provides:
- **Shared benefits** for all users (6 benefits)
- **Male-specific benefits** for nicotine pouches (5 benefits)
- **Female-specific benefits** for nicotine pouches (6 benefits)

### 3. Scientific Accuracy
Each benefit includes:
- Clear, user-friendly title
- Simple description
- Detailed scientific explanation
- Specific timeline (days required)
- Visual icon and color coding

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Gender badges (♂/♀) on gender-specific benefits
- Dynamic explanations based on achievement status
- Personalized subtitle showing product type and gender
- "Personalized benefits based on your profile" messaging

### 5. Key Benefits Implemented

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. `mobile-app/src/types/index.ts` - Added gender fields
2. `mobile-app/src/services/genderSpecificRecoveryService.ts` - New service
3. `mobile-app/src/screens/progress/ProgressScreen.tsx` - UI integration

### Architecture:
- Service provides benefits based on product type + gender + progress stats
- Benefits sorted by achievement status and timeline
- Dynamic explanations change based on days until achievement

## User Experience Flow
1. User selects gender during onboarding (already implemented)
2. Progress screen detects user's gender and product type
3. Displays personalized mix of shared + gender-specific benefits
4. Shows clear scientific explanations without medical jargon
5. Tracks achievement based on days clean

## Next Steps

### Immediate:
1. Test with real user data
2. Verify all gender options display correctly
3. Add gender-specific benefits for other products (cigarettes, vape, dip/chew)

### Future Enhancements:
1. Age-specific modifications
2. Pregnancy-specific pathways
3. Medical condition considerations
4. Export functionality for healthcare providers

## Important Notes
