# Premium Avatar Frame Consistency Fix - June 11, 2025

## Problem
Premium avatars (mythic rarity) were displaying with inconsistent frame colors:
- Some had pink/orange gradient frames
- Others had golden frames
- This created visual inconsistency in the avatar selection screen

## Solution
Updated the mythic rarity color gradient to use a consistent golden premium gradient.

## Changes Made
1. Changed mythic frame colors from `['#EC4899', '#F472B6', '#FB923C']` (pink/orange)
2. To golden premium gradient: `['#FFD700', '#FFA500', '#FF8C00']`
3. This ensures all premium avatars have a consistent, premium-looking golden frame

## Color Breakdown
- #FFD700 - Gold
- #FFA500 - Orange Gold
- #FF8C00 - Dark Orange Gold

## Status
âœ… Complete - All premium avatars now display with consistent golden gradient frames
