# Complete Nicotine Pouches Fix Documentation
**Date:** January 15, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Dashboard Shows "Units" Instead of "Pouches"
- The dashboard was showing "X units" instead of "X pouches" or "X tins"
- This was due to the category detection logic not properly identifying pouches

### 2. Calculator Shows "NICOTINE PRODUCT" Instead of "Nicotine Pouches"
- When clicking the units avoided calculator, it showed generic "NICOTINE PRODUCT"
- Should show "Nicotine Pouches" for users who selected pouches during onboarding

### 3. Onboarding Inconsistency
- The pouches product was defined with `category: 'pouches'`
- But the save logic was checking for `category: 'other'`
- This created a mismatch in data handling

## Root Causes

1. **NicotineProfileStep.tsx**: 
   - Was checking for `selectedProduct.category === 'other'` when pouches have `category: 'pouches'`
   - Missing case statements for 'pouches' category in helper functions

2. **nicotineProducts.ts**:
   - `normalizeProductCategory` was only checking for pouches when category was 'other'
   - Now checks for 'zyn' ID regardless of category

3. **DashboardScreen.tsx**:
   - Working correctly but needed debug logging to diagnose issues

## Fixes Applied

### 1. NicotineProfileStep.tsx
```typescript
// Fixed save logic
} else if (selectedProduct.category === 'pouches' || selectedProduct.id === 'zyn') {
  // For pouches - save dailyAmount as pouches per day
  profileData.tinsPerDay = parseFloat(dailyAmount) / 15; // Convert pouches to tins
}

// Added 'pouches' case to all helper functions
case 'pouches':
  return 'Pouches per day';
```

### 2. nicotineProducts.ts
```typescript
// Check ID first for pouches
if (productId === 'zyn') {
  return 'pouches';
}
```

### 3. Added Debug Logging
- Added console logs to track data flow
- Helps diagnose future issues

## Data Flow for Pouches

1. **Onboarding**: User selects "Nicotine Pouches" with:
   - `id: 'zyn'`
   - `category: 'pouches'`
   - Daily amount entered as pouches per day

2. **Storage**: Saved to user profile with:
   - `nicotineProduct.category: 'pouches'`
   - `nicotineProduct.id: 'zyn'`
   - `dailyAmount`: pouches per day
   - `tinsPerDay`: calculated as pouches / 15

3. **Dashboard Display**:
   - Shows pouches if < 15 avoided
   - Shows tins if >= 15 avoided
   - Properly formatted with singular/plural

4. **Calculator Modal**:
   - Shows "Nicotine Pouches" as product name
   - Allows editing pouches per day
   - Calculates tins automatically

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Go through onboarding and select Nicotine Pouches
- [ ] Enter daily pouches amount (e.g., 10)
- [ ] Dashboard should show "X pouches" or "X tins"
- [ ] Calculator should show "Nicotine Pouches" not "NICOTINE PRODUCT"
- [ ] Editing daily amount should update correctly
