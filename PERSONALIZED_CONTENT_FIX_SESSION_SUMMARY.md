# Personalized Content Fix Session Summary

## 📅 Session Date: January 29, 2025

## 🎯 **Objective**
Fix the issue where users were receiving generic daily tips with research sources from cigarette studies regardless of their actual nicotine product type (pouches, vape, etc.).

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
User reported getting daily science tips with "two research sources from cigarette smoking" even though they were a nicotine pouch user (confirmed by logs showing "pouches avoided: 20").

**Root Cause**: When we reverted to fix dashboard syntax errors, the personalized content service was deleted, causing the app to fall back to generic cigarette-focused content.

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Recreated Personalized Content Service**
- **File**: `mobile-app/src/services/personalizedContentService.ts`
- **Functionality**: Provides product-specific tips and milestones based on user's onboarding data
- **Product Types Supported**: cigarettes, vape, nicotine_pouches, chew_dip, other

### **2. Product-Specific Daily Tips**
**Example for Nicotine Pouches (Day 4)**:
- **Title**: "Gum Sensitivity Improving"
- **Content**: "The constant nicotine exposure that caused gum sensitivity is ending. Your oral pH is normalizing."
- **Sources**: ['Nordic Dental Research', 'International Oral Health Journal']
- **Focus**: Oral health, gum recovery, taste restoration

**vs. Previous Generic Tips (Day 4)**:
- **Title**: "Cilia Recovery is Accelerating" 
- **Content**: About lung hair-like structures (irrelevant for pouch users)
- **Sources**: Cigarette smoking research
- **Focus**: Lung health (not applicable to pouches)

### **3. Updated Daily Tip Service**
- **File**: `mobile-app/src/services/dailyTipService.ts`
- **Change**: Modified `getTodaysTip()` to use `getPersonalizedDailyTips()`
- **Fallback**: Generic tips still available if personalized tips fail
- **Logging**: Enhanced to show "personalized tip" vs "fallback tip"

### **4. Updated Profile Screen Milestones**
- **File**: `mobile-app/src/screens/profile/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- **Change**: Uses `getPersonalizedMilestones()` instead of hard-coded generic milestones
- **Result**: Milestones now relevant to user's product type (e.g., "Oral Health Victory" for pouch users)

## 🎯 **Product-Specific Personalization**

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Smart Product Detection**
```typescript
export const getUserPersonalizedProfile = (): PersonalizedContent => {
  const state = store.getState();
  const onboardingData = selectOnboarding(state);
  const productType = onboardingData.stepData?.nicotineProduct?.category;
  // Returns product-specific configuration
};
```

### **Personalized Tip Selection**
```typescript
export const getPersonalizedDailyTips = (dayNumber: number): PersonalizedDailyTip[] => {
  const profile = getUserPersonalizedProfile();
  const productTips = tipsByProduct[profile.productType];
  // Returns tips relevant to user's product and day
};
```

### **Enhanced Logging**
- `📚 Getting personalized daily tip for day X`
- `📚 Selected personalized tip: "Title" (category) for day X`
- `📚 Using fallback generic tip for day X` (if personalization fails)

## ✅ **Result**
- **Day 4 Nicotine Pouch User** now gets:
  - ✅ "Gum Sensitivity Improving" (relevant)
  - ✅ Nordic Dental Research sources (appropriate)
  - ✅ Oral health focus (correct for pouches)

- **Previously was getting**:

1. **Product-specific daily tips** with relevant research sources
2. **Appropriate milestones** for their recovery journey  
3. **Correct unit names** (pouches vs cigarettes vs puffs)
4. **Relevant health benefits** focus areas
