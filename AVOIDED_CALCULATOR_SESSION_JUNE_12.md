# Avoided Units Calculator Session
## June 12, 2025

### Summary
Implemented an avoided units calculator modal and fixed the redundant "Avoided X tins avoided" display issue on the dashboard.

### Issues Addressed
1. **Redundant Text**: Dashboard showed "Avoided X tins avoided" which was redundant
2. **No Calculation Transparency**: Users couldn't see how avoided units were calculated
3. **No Edit Capability**: Users couldn't update their daily usage amount after onboarding
4. **Inconsistent Data**: Need to ensure data pulls from onboarding flow for consistency

### Changes Made

#### DashboardScreen.tsx
1. **Fixed Redundant Display**:
   - Updated `getAvoidedDisplay()` function to return unit strings without "avoided"
   - Changed from "tins avoided" to just "tins", "packs avoided" to "packs", etc.
   - Display now shows cleanly as "Avoided 5 tins" instead of "Avoided 5 tins avoided"

2. **Made Metric Clickable**:
   - Changed avoided metric from `<View>` to `<TouchableOpacity>`
   - Added "tap to customize" subtext matching money saved card
   - Added click handler to open calculator modal

#### AvoidedCalculatorModal.tsx (New Component)
1. **Product Display**:
   - Shows user's selected nicotine product from onboarding
   - Displays product-specific conversion info (e.g., "20 cigarettes = 1 pack")
   - Uses appropriate icons for each product type

2. **Daily Usage Input**:
   - Text input for users to update their daily consumption
   - Pre-fills with current value from user profile
   - Dynamic unit labels (cigarette/cigarettes, pouch/pouches, etc.)

3. **Calculation Display**:
   - Shows breakdown: Days clean × Daily usage = Total avoided
   - Converts to larger units when applicable (cigarettes → packs, pouches → tins)
   - Real-time calculation updates as user types

4. **Data Persistence**:
   - Updates Redux store (auth and progress slices)
   - Saves to AsyncStorage for persistence
   - Recalculates all stats based on new daily amount
   - Handles different product types appropriately

### Product-Specific Logic
- **Cigarettes**: 20 per pack, shows packs when ≥ 1 pack
- **Nicotine Pouches**: 15 per tin, shows tins when whole number
- **Dip/Chew**: 5 portions per tin average
- **Vape**: Shows as individual pods
- **Other**: Generic unit display

### Technical Details
- Handles special case where pouches are saved as 'other' category with 'zyn' id
- Consistent with onboarding data structure
- Smooth animations and success feedback
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout
