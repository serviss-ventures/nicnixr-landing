# Step 5 (PastAttemptsStep) Redesign - Save Point
## June 1, 2024 - 11:00 PM PST

### Problem Solved
- Step 5 was showing ALL sections at once when "Yes" was selected, creating an overwhelming "goes down forever" form
- Mixed old and new design elements were confusing users
- Too much information requested at once

### New Compact Design Features

#### 1. Clean Toggle Card
- Simple Yes/No toggle for "Have you tried quitting before?"
- Shows answer state visually with checkmark/X icon
- Clean card-based design

#### 2. Compact Info Card
- Side-by-side layout for:
  - Number of attempts (with +/- buttons)
  - Longest quit duration (dropdown selector)
- Divider between sections for clarity

#### 3. Horizontal Duration Pills
- Scrollable horizontal list of duration options
- Visual selection with primary color
- Personalized encouragement appears when duration selected

#### 4. Expandable Sections
- Methods tried - starts expanded
- Challenges faced - starts collapsed
- Only show 4 items initially with "+X more" button
- Count badges show number selected
- Checkmarks show completion

#### 5. Optional Quick Insight
- Single text input for one key lesson
- Limited to 100 characters
- Marked as optional to reduce pressure

### Data Collection for AI
1. **Basic Info**: Number of attempts, longest quit duration
2. **Methods**: What approaches they've tried
3. **Challenges**: What made it difficult
4. **Optional**: One key lesson learned

### Key Design Principles
- Progressive disclosure (collapsible sections)
- Visual feedback (badges, checkmarks)
- Compact layout (no endless scrolling)
- Mobile-optimized (4-column grid, horizontal scrolls)
- Clear hierarchy and spacing

### Technical Implementation
- Removed all old render functions
- Clean state management with expandedSections
- Smooth animations with toggleAnim
- Proper validation without disruptive alerts

### Files Modified
- `mobile-app/src/screens/onboarding/steps/PastAttemptsStep.tsx` - Complete redesign

### Next Steps
- Step 6-8 redesigns following similar compact principles
- Ensure consistent UX across all onboarding steps
