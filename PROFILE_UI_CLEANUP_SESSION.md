# Profile UI Cleanup Session

## Date: January 2025

## Overview
Cleaned up the Profile screen UI/UX to make it more digestible and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Header Redesign
- **Removed grey background**: Eliminated the `backgroundColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.02)'` that was creating an ugly grey bar
- **Improved spacing**: Reduced padding and margins throughout for a more compact design
- **Better visual hierarchy**: Clear flow from avatar → name → stats → bio → edit button

### 2. Avatar Section Improvements
- **Larger avatar size**: Increased to 140px for better prominence
- **Camera icon repositioned**: Moved from right to left side to avoid covering recovery badges
- **Click avatar for info**: Tapping avatar now shows an info modal with avatar details
- **Removed avatar title text**: No longer showing avatar name under username to reduce clutter

### 3. Content Organization
- **Removed "My Why" section**: This data is set during onboarding and doesn't need to be displayed
- **Removed separate journey cards**: Eliminated the redundant "QUITTING" card section
- **Added "Quitting [Product]" text**: Now shows inline under recovery stage badge

### 4. Stats Section
- **Inline layout**: Changed from card-based to inline display with vertical dividers
- **Larger values**: Increased font size to 26px for better readability
- **Better spacing**: Reduced horizontal padding for cleaner look

### 5. Edit Profile Modal Redesign
- **Compact single-screen layout**: No scrolling required
- **Removed unnecessary fields**: Eliminated "Reasons to Quit" and "Personal Reason"
- **Streamlined support styles**: Changed from large cards to compact chips
- **Only essential fields**: Display Name, Bio, and Support Styles

### 6. Edit Modal Final Improvements
- **Fixed visibility issues**: Removed problematic LinearGradient and KeyboardAvoidingView
- **Bio field improvements**: Increased height from 60-80px to 80-100px for better text entry
- **Support style layout**: 3 chips per row (was 2), using 30% flexBasis
- **Reduced spacing**: Smaller margins and padding throughout
- **Fixed sizing**: Icons reduced to 14px, text to 11px
- **No scrolling**: Everything fits in a fixed modal height

### 7. New Avatar Info Modal
When users tap their avatar, they see:
- Avatar name and image
- Rarity badge (Common/Rare/Epic/Legendary)
- Description
- Days together
- When it was unlocked (if applicable)

## Technical Details

### Key Style Changes
```javascript
