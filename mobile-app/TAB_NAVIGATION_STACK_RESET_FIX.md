# Tab Navigation Stack Reset Fix - June 11, 2025

## Issue
Users were getting stuck in nested screens when using tab navigation. Specifically:
- Navigating to Mike S. chat via notification
- Using back button worked correctly (returned to Community buddies tab)
- But tapping the Community tab icon would return to the chat instead of the main Community screen

## Root Cause
React Navigation maintains the navigation stack state for each tab. When you navigate to a nested screen (like BuddyChat within the Community stack), that becomes the active screen in the stack. Tapping the tab icon again just brings the existing stack to the foreground with BuddyChat still active.

## Solution
Added `listeners` to each tab that has a stack navigator to reset the stack when the tab is pressed:

```javascript
listeners={({ navigation }) => ({
  tabPress: (e) => {
    // Reset the stack to the main screen when tab is pressed
    navigation.navigate('TabName', {
      screen: 'MainScreen',
      params: undefined
    });
  },
})}
```

## Changes Made
1. **Community Tab**: Resets to `CommunityMain` on press
2. **Profile Tab**: Resets to `ProfileMain` on press  
3. **Dashboard Tab**: Resets to `Dashboard` on press

## Result
Now when users tap any tab icon:
- The tab's stack navigator resets to its initial route
- No more getting stuck in nested screens
- Clean navigation experience matches user expectations

## User Flow Example
1. User taps notification → Opens BuddyChat
2. User taps back → Goes to Community buddies tab ✓
3. User navigates away to another tab
4. User taps Community tab → Shows Community main screen (not chat) ✓

This provides a more intuitive navigation experience where tab icons always take you to the "home" screen of that section.
