# Complete Notification System Documentation

## Overview
A comprehensive notification system with Redux state management, persistent storage, and full integration with buddy system, milestones, and mentions.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Notification Types**
- **Buddy Requests**: New buddy connection requests
- **Buddy Messages**: Messages from connected buddies
- **Milestones**: Achievement notifications (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
- **Mentions**: When someone @mentions you in posts/comments
- **System**: App updates and announcements

### 2. **UI Components**

#### NotificationBell (`NotificationBell.tsx`)
- Shows unread count badge
- Positioned in dashboard header
- Haptic feedback on tap
- Real-time count from Redux state

#### NotificationCenter (`NotificationCenter.tsx`)
- Full-screen modal (85% height)
- Organized by time (Today/Earlier)
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Different layouts for each notification type
- Smooth animations and transitions

### 3. **Navigation Flow**

#### From Notifications:
- **Buddy Request** → Community tab (Buddies section)
- **Buddy Message** → BuddyChat screen with proper back navigation
- **Milestone** → Progress screen
- **Mention** → Community feed with specific post

#### Back Navigation:
- BuddyChat → Community (Buddies tab)
- Community → Previous screen
- All paths ensure users never get stuck

### 4. **Mention System**

#### Detection:
```javascript
// Regex pattern to match @mentions
/@([A-Za-z]+(?:\s+[A-Za-z]\.?)?)/g
```

#### Features:
- Works in posts and comments
- Auto-complete suggestions while typing
- Clickable mentions navigate to user profiles
- Notifications sent to mentioned users
- Prevents self-mentions

### 5. **State Management**

#### Redux Store (`notificationSlice.ts`)
```typescript
interface NotificationState {
  notifications: Notification[];
  unreadCount: number;
  loading: boolean;
  error: string | null;
}
```

#### Actions:
- `setNotifications`: Load from storage
- `addNotification`: Add new notification
- `removeNotification`: Delete notification
- `markAsRead`: Mark as read
- `markAllAsRead`: Mark all as read
- `saveNotifications`: Persist to AsyncStorage

### 6. **Data Persistence**
- All notifications saved to AsyncStorage
- Survives app restarts
- Automatic loading on app start
- Real-time syncing between state and storage

## Implementation Details

### Creating Notifications

#### Buddy Request:
```javascript
NotificationService.createBuddyRequestNotification({
  id: 'buddy-123',
  name: 'Sarah M.',
  daysClean: 45,
  avatar: 'warrior',
  product: 'vaping',
  bio: 'Looking for accountability partner',
  supportStyles: ['Motivator'],
  status: 'online'
});
```

#### Mention:
```javascript
NotificationService.createMentionNotification(
  {
    id: 'user-123',
    name: 'John Doe',
    daysClean: 30
  },
  {
    type: 'comment',
    postId: 'post-456',
    postAuthor: 'Jane Smith',
    content: '@John Doe great progress!'
  }
);
```

### Mention Detection in Posts/Comments

When creating a post or comment:
1. Extract mentions using regex
2. Find matching users from community
3. Create notification for each mentioned user
4. Exclude self-mentions

```javascript
const mentionedUserIds = extractMentions(content);
for (const userId of mentionedUserIds) {
  const user = getAllUsers().find(u => u.id === userId);
  if (user) {
    await NotificationService.createMentionNotification(...);
  }
}
```

## Production Considerations

### 1. **Backend Integration**
Replace mock implementations with real API calls:
- WebSocket for real-time notifications
- Push notifications for background alerts
- Server-side mention detection
- Notification read receipts

### 2. **Performance**
- Limit stored notifications (e.g., last 100)
- Pagination for large notification lists
- Batch notification updates
- Debounce mention detection

### 3. **Security**
- Validate mention permissions
- Rate limit notification creation
- Sanitize notification content
- Verify buddy relationships

### 4. **Scalability**
- Queue system for notification delivery
- Notification preferences per user
- Batch processing for mentions
- Efficient storage strategies

## Migration Guide

For existing users:
1. First app launch creates empty notification state
2. New notifications start appearing immediately
3. No migration needed for existing data
4. Backward compatible with current features
