# Admin User Management Implementation - January 13, 2025

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive user management functionality in the NixR admin dashboard, including:
- Account Settings page for admins to manage their profiles
- Admin Permissions page to manage admin users and roles
- Add User functionality on the Users page
- Functional admin dropdown menu with working navigation

## Features Implemented

### 1. Account Settings Page (`/account-settings`)
- **Location**: `admin-dashboard/src/app/account-settings/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - View and edit admin email and username
  - Change password functionality
  - Security settings (2FA toggle, login notifications)
  - Save changes button with loading state

### 2. Admin Permissions Page (`/admin-permissions`)
- **Location**: `admin-dashboard/src/app/admin-permissions/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - View all admin users with their roles
  - Add new admin users with different permission levels
  - Delete admin users (except primary admin)
  - Role types: Super Admin, Admin, Moderator, Support
  - Shows last login time and creation date

### 3. Add User Functionality
- **Location**: Updated `admin-dashboard/src/app/users/page.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - "Add User" button in header
  - Modal to create new users with:
    - Email (required)
    - Username (required)
    - Full Name (optional)
    - Nicotine Product selection
  - Creates user in Supabase Auth
  - Auto-generates password and sends email

### 4. Admin Menu Updates
- **Location**: `admin-dashboard/src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Account Settings and Admin Permissions buttons now navigate to their pages
  - Sign out functionality updated to clear simple auth cookie
  - Proper Link components instead of non-functional buttons

## Current State
- All admin menu items are now functional
- Users can be added through the UI (integrates with Supabase)
- Admin permissions can be managed (currently using local state)
- Account settings page ready for backend integration

## Production Considerations
1. **Authentication**: Currently using simple cookie auth - needs proper implementation
2. **Admin Users Table**: Need to create `admin_users` table in Supabase for persistence
3. **Password Reset**: Need to implement actual password change functionality
4. **Email Service**: Ensure email service is configured for user invitations
5. **Security**: Add proper role-based access control (RBAC)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Create `admin_users` table in Supabase
2. Implement proper authentication with JWT tokens
3. Add API endpoints for:
   - Updating account settings
   - Managing admin permissions
   - Password changes
4. Set up email templates for user invitations
5. Add audit logging for admin actions
6. Implement 2FA for admin accounts

## Testing
1. Navigate to admin dashboard
2. Click on "Admin" dropdown in bottom left
3. Test "Account Settings" - should show profile management page
4. Test "Admin Permissions" - should show admin user management
5. Go to Users page and click "Add User" button
6. Try creating a new user (will work with Supabase connection)
7. Test "Sign out" - should redirect to login page

## Security Notes
- Primary admin (admin@nixrapp.com) cannot be deleted
- New users receive auto-generated passwords via email
- All sensitive operations should be logged in production
- Consider implementing IP whitelisting for admin access
