# Production Data Requirements for Quality AI Responses

## Essential User Data to Store

### 1. **User Profile** (users table) ✅ Already Created
```sql
- id (UUID)
- days_clean (calculated from quit_date)
- substance_type (cigarettes, vape, etc.)
- quit_date
- relapse_count
- longest_streak
```

### 2. **Daily Journal Entries** (journal_entries table) ✅ Already Created
```sql
- mood_positive (boolean)
- craving_intensity (1-10)
- anxiety_level (1-10)
- sleep_hours
- triggers_encountered
- notes (text)
```
This gives AI context like: "I see yesterday you had a 9/10 craving but pushed through"

### 3. **AI Conversation History** (ai_coach_messages table) ✅ Already Created
```sql
- message_text
- sentiment (positive/negative/crisis)
- topics (cravings, stress, celebration)
- risk_level
```
Enables: "Last week you mentioned stress from work was a trigger"

### 4. **User Achievements** (achievements table) ✅ Already Created
```sql
- achievement_type
- unlocked_at
- milestone_value
```
Allows: "Hey, you just hit your 1-week milestone! Remember when day 1 felt impossible?"

### 5. **Recovery Patterns** (Not yet implemented)
```sql
- common_trigger_times (e.g., "after meals", "morning")
- successful_coping_strategies
- relapse_patterns
```
Enables: "It's 3pm - I know this is usually when cravings hit for you"

## How This Creates Quality Responses

### Example 1: Personalized Craving Support
**With Data:**
"Tough one today, huh? I remember you said deep breathing helped last Tuesday when you had that 8/10 craving. Worth a shot?"

**Without Data:**
"Try some deep breathing exercises"

### Example 2: Pattern Recognition
**With Data:**
"Mornings are rough for you, I know. You've pushed through 7 of them now though - that's huge!"

**Without Data:**
"How are you feeling today?"

### Example 3: Progress Celebration
**With Data:**
"Dude! You've saved $49 already and your anxiety is down from 8 to 5 this week. Your body's already thanking you!"

**Without Data:**
"Good job on your progress"

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Set up real user authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Enable session/message storage (remove temporary bypasses)
- [ ] Create background job to calculate daily stats
- [ ] Add journal entry syncing
- [ ] Build user insights engine
- [ ] Create data retention policies (privacy)

## Privacy Considerations

1. **Anonymize sensitive data** - No names in AI prompts
2. **Local-first approach** - Sync only when online
3. **User control** - Let users delete their data
4. **Encryption** - Sensitive journal entries
5. **Minimal retention** - Old conversations can be summarized

## Quick Wins for Better Responses

1. **Track last 5 conversations** - Immediate context
2. **Store top 3 coping strategies** - Quick personalization  
3. **Note craving patterns** - Time of day, triggers
4. **Remember milestones** - Celebrate appropriately
5. **Monitor mood trends** - Adjust tone accordingly

## The Result

With proper data storage, your AI coach can say things like:
- "It's been 3 days since your last strong craving - you're getting stronger!"
- "Remember what you told me about your kid being your motivation?"
- "Your sleep's been better this week (7 hours vs 5) - that's helping with cravings, right?"
- "You've used the app 7 days straight - I love the commitment!"

This is what makes it feel like a real friend who actually knows and cares about their journey.
