## Known Limitations

1. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Uses simple cookie auth (not production ready)
   - Changes don't persist (local state only)
   - Mock data instead of real Supabase data

2. **Mobile App**
   - Analytics disabled by default
   - Community posts not persisted to database
   - Daily tips using basic implementation

## Next Development Steps

1. Enable proper Supabase auth for admin dashboard
2. Apply database migrations
3. Connect admin dashboard to real data
