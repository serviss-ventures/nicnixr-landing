# Community Comment System Rebuild - June 7, 2025

## Overview
Complete reconstruction of the comment system in the Community feed to fix critical UX issues and add proper functionality.

## Problems Fixed
1. **Layout Issues**
   - Comments were hidden under the message bar
   - Modal height was incorrect causing content to be cut off
   - Keyboard handling was broken
   - Input field was not properly positioned

2. **Functionality Issues**
   - Comments weren't actually being stored or displayed
   - Comment count was just a number, not linked to real data
   - No way to view existing comments
   - Poor keyboard and scrolling behavior

## Implementation Details

### Data Structure
- Added proper `Comment` interface with all necessary fields
- Updated `CommunityPost` to store array of comments instead of just count

     - Comment content
     - Like button (ready for functionality)
   
3. **Input Section**
   - Fixed at bottom of modal
