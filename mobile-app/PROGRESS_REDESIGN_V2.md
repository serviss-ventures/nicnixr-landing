## Key Differentiators from Dashboard

1. **Depth vs. Summary**: Dashboard = snapshot, Progress = deep dive
2. **Time Focus**: Dashboard = now, Progress = past/present/future
3. **Motivation**: Dashboard = quick wins, Progress = long-term vision
4. **Interaction**: Dashboard = glanceable, Progress = explorable

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (MVP)
1. Journey tab with timeline
2. Basic achievements grid
3. Simple trends (1-2 charts)

### Phase 2
1. Interactive body systems
2. AI insights
3. Advanced analytics

### Phase 3
1. Social features
2. Predictive modeling
3. Gamification elements

## Success Metrics
- Average session time > 2 minutes
- Weekly return rate > 80%
- Achievement share rate > 10%
- User satisfaction > 4.5/5

This design makes Progress the place users go to understand their recovery deeply, while Dashboard remains the quick-check home base.
