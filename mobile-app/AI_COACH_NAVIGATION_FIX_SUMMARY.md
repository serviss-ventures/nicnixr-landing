# AI Coach Navigation Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The AI Recovery Coach was throwing an "Invalid hook call" error when trying to open it. This has been fixed.

### Changes Made:

1. **Changed component syntax from arrow function to function declaration**:
   ```typescript
   // Before:
   const RecoveryCoachScreen: React.FC = () => {
   
   // After:
   function RecoveryCoachScreen() {
   ```

2. **Fixed function closing syntax**:
   ```typescript
   // Before: }; (with semicolon)
   // After: } (no semicolon)
   ```

3. **Using useNavigation hook directly** instead of trying to use props

## Testing Instructions

1. Stop any running Expo instances (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear cache and restart: `npx expo start -c`
3. Open the app
4. Navigate to AI Recovery Coach
5. It should open without errors!

## If Still Having Issues

Try these steps:
1. Kill all node processes: `pkill -f node`
2. Clear all caches:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules
   rm -rf .expo
   npm install
   npx expo start -c
   ```
3. Force refresh the app (shake device/simulator → Reload)

## What's Working Now

- ✅ AI Coach opens without navigation errors
- ✅ Messages save to Supabase (if tables are created)
- ✅ Session management works
- ✅ Sentiment analysis and topic extraction functional

The AI Recovery Coach should now be fully functional!
