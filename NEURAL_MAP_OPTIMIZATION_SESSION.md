# Neural Map Optimization Session

## Date: January 2025

## Overview
This session focused on optimizing the neural map visualization on the dashboard, improving performance, and simplifying the user interface by removing redundant information.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Neural Map Visual Improvements
- **Better Text Visibility**: Added dark backdrop behind "Days Free" text to ensure readability against green particles
- **Progressive Activation**: Adjusted particle activation thresholds for better visual feedback in first 10 days
  - Core particles: Days 0-3
  - Inner ring: Days 1-7
  - Middle rings: Days 3-30
  - Outer ring: Days 20-60
- **Enhanced Visual Elements**: Increased glow effects, particle opacity, and connection line visibility

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Reduced Particle Count**: From ~170 to ~110 particles (35% reduction)
- **Simplified Animations**: Removed complex wave and pulse animations on individual particles
- **Static Center Text**: Removed animation from days display to prevent jumping
- **Optimized Rendering**: Using simple SVG elements instead of animated components

### 3. Scientific Accuracy Updates
- **Updated Recovery Timeline**: Adjusted dopamine pathway recovery to be more scientifically accurate
  - 90% recovery by day 90 (primary recovery phase)
  - 95% by 6 months (extended recovery)
  - 98% by 1 year (long-term recovery)
  - Never reaches 100% (brain maintains plasticity)

### 4. UI Simplification
- **Removed Pathway Recovery Badge**: Eliminated the "X% pathway recovery" badge below neural map
- **Reasoning**: 
  - Avoided confusion between pathway recovery % and overall recovery %
  - Neural map itself visually represents brain recovery
  - Detailed metrics available in Progress tab for power users
  - Cleaner, less cluttered interface

### 5. Code Cleanup
- Removed `neuralBadgeMessage` from recovery tracking service
- Removed `getNeuralBadgeMessage` function
- Cleaned up unused state variables and styles
- Fixed debug test file references

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `mobile-app/src/components/common/EnhancedNeuralNetwork.tsx`
   - Optimized particle system
   - Improved text visibility
   - Simplified animations

2. `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`
   - Removed neural badge component
   - Cleaned up unused state and styles

3. `mobile-app/src/services/recoveryTrackingService.ts`
   - Updated recovery calculation algorithm
   - Removed badge-related functions

4. `mobile-app/src/debug/neuralGrowthTest.ts`
