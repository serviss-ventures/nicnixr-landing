# Profile UI Fixes - June 7, 2025

## Summary
Fixed several UI issues on the Profile screen to improve visual hierarchy and user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Camera Icon Repositioning
- **Issue**: Camera icon was overlapping with achievement badges (like "Year Legend")
- **Fix**: Moved camera icon from bottom-right to top-right position (top: 0, right: 0)

### 2. Limited Drops Timer Fix
- **Issue**: Timer was showing redundant information ("11d 19h 11m" followed by "11 Days Only")
- **Fix**: Changed right side to display "Limited Edition" instead of repeating day count

### 3. Spacing Improvements
- **My Why Section**: Reduced vertical padding and gaps to eliminate excessive white space
- **Developer Tools Section**: Tightened spacing between sections and within settings items
- **Sign Out Button**: Reduced margins and padding for better visual consistency

### 4. Avatar Modal Cleanup
- **Issue**: Redundant titles "Choose Your Avatar" and "Choose Your Hero"
- **Fix**: Removed "Choose Your Hero" section title, kept only the subtitle "Pick your recovery companion"
