# Compatible Tab Navigation Fix - June 12, 2025

## Problem
The `StackActions.popToTop()` approach was causing an error:
```
ERROR The action 'POP_TO_TOP' was not handled by any navigator.
Is there any screen to go back to?
```

This happens because `popToTop()` doesn't work reliably with nested navigators in React Navigation.

## Solution
Changed to a simpler navigation approach that checks the current state and navigates to the main screen:

```javascript
listeners={({ navigation }) => ({
  tabPress: (e) => {
    const state = navigation.getState();
    const currentRoute = state?.routes[state.index];
    
    if (currentRoute?.name === 'Community' && currentRoute?.state?.index > 0) {
      // Navigate back to the main screen
      navigation.navigate('Community', {
        screen: 'CommunityMain'
      });
    }
  },
})}
```

## How It Works
1. Gets the current navigation state
2. Checks if we're on the current tab AND not on the main screen (index > 0)
3. If so, navigates to the main screen of that tab
4. Otherwise, lets the default tab press behavior happen

## Benefits
- No more POP_TO_TOP errors
- Still prevents the toggle issue
- Works reliably with nested navigators
- Smooth navigation without glitches
