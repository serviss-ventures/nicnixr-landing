### User Request

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed Visual Components
- **Neural Network Visualization**: Removed the animated brain recovery map
- **Recovery Explanation**: Removed "Your Brain Recovery Map" section
- **Hours Clean Display**: Removed the hours clean overlay for early days

#### 2. Code Cleanup
- Removed `NeuralNetworkVisualization` component definition
- Removed `getRecoveryData` function (no longer needed)

- `neuralExplanation`
- `neuralExplanationHeader`
- `neuralExplanationTitle`
- `neuralExplanationText`
- `neuralNetworkContainer`
- `enhancedNeuralContainer`
- `enhancedStatsOverlay`
- `hoursCleanText`

#### 4. Layout Adjustments
- Increased top padding from `SPACING.sm` to `SPACING.md`
- More breathing room for metrics grid
- Better focus on core stats

### Benefits
1. **Cleaner Interface**: Less visual clutter
2. **Better Focus**: Draws attention to days free and key metrics
3. **Improved Performance**: Removed complex animations
4. **Simplified Code**: ~150 lines of code removed

### Files Modified
- `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`

### Note
The `EnhancedNeuralNetwork` component itself remains in the codebase as it's still used in:
- `NeuralNetworkDemo.tsx` (for educational purposes)
- Other potential future uses

The removal only affects the dashboard display.
