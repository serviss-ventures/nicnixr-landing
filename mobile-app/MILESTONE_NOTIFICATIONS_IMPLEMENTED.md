# Milestone Notifications Implementation - June 11, 2025

## Summary
Fixed the issue where milestone notifications weren't being triggered when users reached milestones (like 1 year clean).

## Issue
The milestone notification system was built but never integrated with the progress tracking system. The `checkMilestones` and `checkHealthBenefits` methods existed in `NotificationService` but were never called.

## Solution
Integrated milestone checking into the Redux progress tracking system:

### 1. Modified `updateProgress` thunk in `progressSlice.ts`
```typescript
// Track previous days clean for comparison
const previousDaysClean = state.progress.stats.daysClean;

// After calculating new progress...
// Check for milestones and create notifications
await NotificationService.checkMilestones(daysClean, previousDaysClean);
await NotificationService.checkHealthBenefits(daysClean, previousDaysClean);
```

### 2. Modified `initializeProgress` thunk
```typescript
// Check for any milestones already achieved (0 as previous days to check all)
await NotificationService.checkMilestones(daysClean, 0);
await NotificationService.checkHealthBenefits(daysClean, 0);
```

## How It Works
- When progress is updated (every minute), the system checks if any new milestones have been reached
- Milestones checked: 1, 3, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 365 days
- Health benefits are also checked at specific intervals
- Notifications are created automatically when milestones are reached
- Each milestone only triggers once (won't repeat if already achieved)

## Testing
To test milestone notifications:
1. Use the Neural Test feature in Profile > Developer Settings
2. Set recovery time to different milestones (Day 1, Week 1, Year 1, etc.)
3. Check the notification bell - you should see milestone notifications

## Milestone Messages
- **1 Day**: "You've made it through your first day!"
- **3 Days**: "3 days strong! Your body is thanking you."
- **7 Days**: "One week milestone achieved! ðŸŽ‰"
- **14 Days**: "Two weeks of freedom! You're unstoppable!"
- **30 Days**: "30 days clean! You've built a new habit!"
- **60 Days**: "60 days! Your brain chemistry is transforming!"
- **90 Days**: "90 days! You've reached a major milestone!"
- **180 Days**: "6 months free! You're an inspiration!"
- **365 Days**: "One year! You've completely transformed your life!"

## Technical Details
- Notifications are stored in Redux with AsyncStorage persistence
- Milestone notifications appear with a trophy icon and gold color
- Health benefit notifications appear with a heart icon and green color
- Tapping a milestone notification navigates to the Progress screen
