# Step 3 Modal Update Summary

## Overview
Replaced the inline text input for custom reasons in Step 3 with the modal popup style from Step 4 for better consistency and improved user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Replaced Inline Input with Modal
- Removed the inline text input that would appear below the reason cards
- Added a modal popup that slides up from the bottom (same as Step 4)
- Modal provides better keyboard handling and cleaner UI

### 2. UI Improvements
- "Add personal reason" button now opens modal instead of expanding inline
- When a custom reason is saved, it shows as a styled card below the options
- Custom reason card shows the text with edit button
- Button text changes to "Edit personal reason" when one exists

### 3. Better Selection Counting
- Selection count now includes custom reason (if entered)
- Custom reason gets its own colored dot in the selection indicator
- More accurate motivation count

### 4. Consistent Design
- Modal uses same design patterns as Step 4
- Drag indicator, close button, and save button all match
- Better handling of keyboard on both iOS and Android
- Character counter in modal footer

### 5. Removed Code
- Deleted all inline input-related styles
- Removed scroll-to-input functionality (no longer needed)
- Cleaned up animation code for inline input

## Result
Step 3 now has a cleaner, more consistent design that matches Step 4's modal approach. The custom reason input no longer causes layout issues or keyboard problems, providing a smoother user experience.
