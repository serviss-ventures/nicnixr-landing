# Notification System Implementation - June 11, 2025

## Overview
Implemented a complete notification system for the NicNixr app with a notification bell in the dashboard header and a full-featured notification center modal.

## What We Built

### 1. **Notification Bell Component** (`NotificationBell.tsx`)
- Clean bell icon with badge counter
- Shows unread count (up to 99+)
- Haptic feedback on tap
- Positioned in top-right of dashboard

### 2. **Notification Center Modal** (`NotificationCenter.tsx`)
- Beautiful slide-up modal (85% screen height)
- Dark theme matching app aesthetic
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Time-based grouping (Today/Earlier)
- Drag handle for dismissal

### 3. **Notification Types**
#### Buddy Requests
- Shows buddy avatar with days clean badge
- Accept (green) / Decline (red) action buttons
- Product tag (cigarettes, vaping, etc.)
- Confirmation dialogs for actions

#### Buddy Messages
- Message preview with sender info
- Tap to navigate to chat
- Shows unread indicator

#### Milestone Achievements
- Custom icons with themed colors
- Celebrates recovery milestones
- Tap to view progress details

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
- Added welcome header with user name and days clean
- Notification bell in top-right corner
- Currently shows 2 unread notifications (demo data)
- Opens notification center on tap

### 5. **Settings Integration**
- Notification preferences accessible from Profile > Settings > Notifications
- Toggle switches for:
  - Daily Motivation
  - Progress Updates
  - Health Milestones
  - Community Activity
- Quiet hours configuration

## User Flow
1. User sees notification bell with badge count on dashboard
2. Taps bell to open notification center
3. Sees grouped notifications (Today/Earlier)
4. Can interact with each notification:
   - Accept/decline buddy requests
   - Tap messages to open chat
   - Tap milestones to view progress
5. Pull down to refresh
6. Swipe down or tap backdrop to close

## Technical Details
- Uses Redux for state management (settings slice)
- Haptic feedback throughout
- Smooth animations
- Responsive design
- Empty state when no notifications

## Demo Data
Currently showing sample notifications:
- Sarah M. buddy request (5m ago)
- Mike S. message (30m ago)  
- 7-day milestone achievement (2h ago)

## Next Steps for Backend Integration
1. Replace demo data with real notifications from backend
2. Implement push notification service
3. Add real-time updates via WebSocket/polling
4. Persist read/unread state
5. Add notification actions API calls
6. Implement notification deletion/archiving
