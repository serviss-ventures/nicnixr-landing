# Avatar Hair Styles Fix - June 11, 2025

## Problem
Several avatars were appearing without hair due to unpredictable seed generation:
- Year Legend
- Season Survivor
- Progress avatars

## Solution
Instead of relying on seed modifiers to randomly generate hair, we now explicitly specify hair styles for premium and progress avatars.

## Changes Made
1. Added `hair` property to DicebearOptions interface with proper type
2. Force specific hair styles for avatars with rarity: mythic, rare, epic, or legendary
3. Hair styles used: "full", "pixie", "turban", "fonze" - all have visible hair

## Technical Details
- Updated DicebearAvatar.tsx to include hair styles array
- Avatars will randomly choose from the provided hair styles but all options have visible hair
- This ensures consistent appearance for premium and progress avatars

## Status
âœ… Complete - All avatars should now display with hair consistently
