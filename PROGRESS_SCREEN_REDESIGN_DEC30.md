# Progress Screen Redesign - User-Friendly Recovery Journey
**Date**: December 30, 2024
**Goal**: Make the recovery phases crystal clear and intuitive

## üéØ Design Changes

### OLD Design Problems:
- Showed "1%" or "0%" for active phases - confusing!
- Users didn't understand what percentages meant
- Unclear when phases would start
- No indication of progress within a phase

### NEW Design Solutions:

#### 1. Clear Status Indicators
Instead of confusing percentages in the header:
- ‚úÖ **Complete** - Green checkmark with "Complete" text
- üîµ **Active** - Pulsing dot with "Day X of Y" progress
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Upcoming** - Clock icon with "Starts in X days"

#### 2. Contextual Progress Information
For active phases, we now show:
- **Acute Recovery**: "Day 1 of 11"
- **Tissue Restoration**: "Week 2 of 10"
- **Neural Rewiring**: "Month 1 of 5"
- **System Optimization**: "Month 7"

#### 3. Progress Bars Only When Relevant
- Progress bars ONLY appear for active phases
- Shown below the header with clear "X% complete" label
- No more confusing 0% or 1% bars

## üì± User Experience at Day 3

```

Neural Rewiring      0%  [        ]
System Optimization  1%  [‚ñå       ]  
```

```

## üé® Visual Hierarchy

2. **Active phase**: Highlighted with color and progress
3. **Upcoming phases**: Muted with countdown info
