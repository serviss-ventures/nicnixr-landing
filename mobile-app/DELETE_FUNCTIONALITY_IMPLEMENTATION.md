# Delete Functionality Implementation - June 11, 2025

## Overview
Added the ability for users to delete their own posts and comments in the community feed, giving users control over their content.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Post Deletion
- **Delete Button**: Red trash icon appears in post actions (right side) only for posts authored by the current user
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows "Delete Post" alert with warning message
- **Haptic Feedback**: Medium impact feedback on deletion
- **Instant Removal**: Post disappears immediately from the feed

### 2. Comment Deletion
- **Delete Button**: Red trash icon appears next to like button only for comments authored by the current user
- **Confirmation Dialog**: Shows "Delete Comment" alert
- **Haptic Feedback**: Light impact feedback on deletion
- **Modal Update**: Comment is removed from both the main feed and the comment modal if open

## Technical Implementation

### Functions Added
1. **handleDeletePost(postId)**: Removes post from communityPosts state
2. **handleDeleteComment(postId, commentId)**: Removes comment from specific post

### UI Components
- Delete buttons styled with red color (#EF4444)
- Positioned appropriately:
  - Posts: Far right in action bar with `marginLeft: 'auto'`
  - Comments: In comment actions next to like button

### Confirmation Dialogs
- Title: "Delete Post" / "Delete Comment"
- Message: Clear warning about permanent deletion
- Actions: Cancel (default) and Delete (destructive)

## User Experience
1. User taps delete icon on their own content
2. Confirmation dialog appears
3. User can cancel or confirm deletion
4. Content is immediately removed from view
5. Haptic feedback confirms action

## Production Notes
- Currently updates local state only
- In production, would need to:
  - Call API endpoint to delete from database
  - Handle loading states
  - Show error messages if deletion fails
  - Consider soft delete for content moderation

## Security
- Delete buttons only render for content where `authorId === user?.id`
- Backend should verify ownership before allowing deletion
- Consider implementing soft deletes for audit trail
