# Community Section Improvements - January 11, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on improving the community section with several key enhancements to make it more production-ready and user-friendly.

## Changes Made

### 1. üö´ Removed Additional Details from Report Modal
- **Issue**: The report modal had a text input field that was causing keyboard issues on iOS
- **Solution**: Removed the entire "Additional details" input section
- **Result**: Report modal is now a simple preselection interface with 5 preset reasons
- **Benefits**:
  - No keyboard issues
  - Faster reporting process
  - Cleaner UI
  - Better UX - users can quickly select and submit

### 2. ‚úçÔ∏è Simplified Community Posting System
- **Issue**: Post creation had too many options (Share Story, Ask Question, Milestone, Need Support)
- **Solution**: Removed all post type functionality
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `type` field from `CommunityPost` interface
  - Removed post type selection buttons
  - Removed type-specific styling (crisis headers, milestone icons, etc.)
  - Simplified placeholder text to "Share your thoughts with the community..."
- **Result**: Clean, simple posting system without categorization complexity

### 3. üë§ Fixed "Demo User" Issue
- **Issue**: Posts were showing as from "demo user" instead of actual profile
- **Solution**: Improved user data resolution with proper fallback hierarchy:
  1. Display name (if set)
  2. Username
  3. First name + Last name
  4. "Anonymous" (instead of "demo_user")
- **Applied to**: Both post creation and comment creation
- **Added**: Debug logging to help identify user data issues

### 4. üîó Implemented Share Functionality
- **Issue**: Share button on posts did nothing
- **Solution**: Added production-grade share functionality using React Native's Share API
- **Features**:
  - Smart content preview (truncates long posts to 100 chars)
  - Rich formatted share message with author info and app download link
  - Native share sheet (works with all installed apps)
  - Haptic feedback on successful share
  - Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- **Share Message Format**:
  ```
  üí≠ From [Author Name] (Day [X]):
  
  "[Post content preview]"
