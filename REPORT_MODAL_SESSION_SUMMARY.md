## Date: June 11, 2025

### Summary
Created a comprehensive report modal for the buddy chat feature, allowing users to report inappropriate behavior or issues to help@nixrapp.com.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Report Modal Interface
- **Design**: Beautiful slide-up modal with gradient background
- **Header**: Orange flag icon with title "Report Issue" and subtitle "Help us keep the community safe"
- **Close button**: X button in top right corner

#### 2. Report Reasons
- Multiple predefined reasons with icons:
  - Inappropriate behavior (warning icon)
  - Harassment or bullying (hand icon)
  - Spam or scam (mail icon)
  - Fake profile (person-remove icon)
  - Other (ellipsis icon)
- Selection shows checkmark and highlights in orange
- Clean card-based design for each option

#### 3. Description Field
- Optional text area for additional details
- 500 character limit with character counter
- Placeholder text: "Tell us more about what happened..."
- Proper keyboard handling on iOS

#### 4. Actions
- Cancel button: Dismisses modal and clears form
- Submit Report button: 
  - Gradient orange/red design
  - Disabled until a reason is selected
  - Shows success alert mentioning help@nixrapp.com
  - Mentions 24-hour review timeframe

### Technical Details

  - `showReportModal`: Controls modal visibility
  - `reportReason`: Selected report reason
  - `reportDescription`: Optional description text
- Proper keyboard avoiding behavior
- Haptic feedback on submission
- Form validation (requires reason selection)

### User Experience

2. Modal slides up from bottom
3. User selects a reason (required)
4. User can optionally add description
5. Submit shows success message mentioning email will go to help@nixrapp.com
6. Form resets after submission

### Future Enhancements
