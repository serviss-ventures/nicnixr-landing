# Product-Specific Progress Screen Fix - January 2025

## Issue Identified
User reported that after going through the nicotine pouch flow, the Progress screen was showing:
- "Lungs & Breathing" as one of the system recovery metrics
- "Oxygen levels recover" in the recovery timeline
- Other cigarette-specific benefits that don't apply to pouches

This was a critical UX issue as it made the app feel generic and not tailored to their specific nicotine product.

## Root Cause
1. The `scientificRecoveryService.ts` was using the same recovery metrics for ALL nicotine products
2. The Progress screen was showing generic benefits regardless of product type
3. No filtering was happening based on the user's selected product during onboarding

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Scientific Recovery Service Updates
Added product-specific metric filtering in `scientificRecoveryService.ts`:

```typescript
function getProductSpecificMetrics(productType?: string): RecoveryMetric[] {
  const productMetricMap: Record<string, string[]> = {
    cigarettes: [
      'dopamine_receptors',
      'prefrontal_function',
      'neurotransmitter_balance',
      'cardiovascular_function',
      'respiratory_function', // ✓ Relevant for cigarettes
      'metabolic_function',
      'inflammatory_markers',
      'sensory_function',
      'sleep_architecture'
    ],
    nicotine_pouches: [
      'dopamine_receptors',
      'prefrontal_function',
      'neurotransmitter_balance',
      'cardiovascular_function',
      // NO respiratory_function for pouches ✗
      'metabolic_function',
      'inflammatory_markers',
      'sensory_function', // Especially taste
      'sleep_architecture'
    ],
    // ... other products
  };
}
```

### 2. Progress Screen Benefits
Created product-specific recovery timelines:

#### Cigarettes
- 20 Minutes: Heart Rate Normalizes
- 8 Hours: **Oxygen Levels Recover** ✓
- 24 Hours: Nicotine Leaves System
- 1 Week: **Lung Cilia Regenerate** ✓
- 2 Weeks: **Lung Function Increases** ✓
- 1 Month: Circulation Restored
- 3 Months: **Respiratory Health** ✓

#### Nicotine Pouches
- 20 Minutes: Heart Rate Normalizes
- 8 Hours: **Oral Tissue Recovery** ✓
- 24 Hours: Nicotine Leaves System
- 1 Week: **Taste Sensation Returns** ✓
- 2 Weeks: **Gum Health Restored** ✓
- 1 Month: **Oral Cancer Risk Drops** ✓

- 1 Month: **Respiratory Recovery** ✓
- 3 Months: **Brain Fog Clears** ✓

#### Dip/Chew
- 8 Hours: **Mouth Sores Begin Healing** ✓
- 1 Week: **Jaw Tension Released** ✓
- 1 Month: **Gum Recession Stops** ✓
- 3 Months: **Oral Cancer Risk Plummets** ✓

### 3. Body Systems Display
Updated to show relevant systems only:

#### For Cigarettes/Vape:
- Brain & Nervous System
- Heart & Circulation
- **Lungs & Breathing** ✓
- Metabolism & Energy

#### For Pouches/Dip:
- Brain & Nervous System
- Heart & Circulation
- **Oral Health & Taste** ✓ (instead of lungs)
- Metabolism & Energy

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Cigarette users see lung-related benefits and metrics
- [ ] Pouch users see oral health benefits, NO lung metrics
- [ ] Vape users see appropriate chemical clearance messaging
- [ ] Dip users see jaw/gum specific recovery
- [ ] All users see common neurological recovery benefits
- [ ] Body systems tab shows appropriate organs

## Future Improvements
1. Add more granular product-specific metrics (e.g., throat recovery for vape)
2. Include product-specific withdrawal symptoms in phase descriptions
3. Add visual indicators (icons) that match the product type
4. Consider adding product-specific recovery tips

## Files Modified
1. `mobile-app/src/services/scientificRecoveryService.ts`
   - Added `getProductSpecificMetrics()` function
   - Updated `calculateScientificRecovery()` to use filtered metrics

2. `mobile-app/src/screens/progress/ProgressScreen.tsx`
   - Added `getProductSpecificBenefits()` function
   - Updated `SystemRecovery` component to show relevant systems
   - Made recovery timeline product-aware

## Impact
This fix ensures users see recovery information that's actually relevant to their nicotine product, making the app feel personalized and scientifically accurate for their specific journey.
