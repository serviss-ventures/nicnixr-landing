2. Review and update legal documents (Privacy Policy & Terms)
3. Create comprehensive testing documentation
4. Work on launch checklist items

## 📝 Work Completed:

### 1. Brand Cleanup - NicNix → NIXR
**Status**: ✅ Reviewed

Found instances of "NicNix" in:
- Various documentation files (mostly historical)
- Old save point files
- Historical documentation

**Decision**: Most active files already use "NixR". Historical documentation files should be preserved as-is for accuracy. The main codebase and user-facing content is already updated.

**Files Already Updated**:
- ✅ README.md (already uses NixR)
- ✅ Legal content (Privacy Policy & Terms already use NixR)
- ✅ Main app codebase (per previous BRAND_UPDATE_NIXR_COMPLETE.md)

### 2. Legal Compliance Review
**Status**: ✅ Completed

- ✅ Reviewed Privacy Policy - Already uses "NixR" consistently
- ✅ Reviewed Terms of Service - Already uses "NixR" consistently
- ✅ Both documents are comprehensive and up-to-date
- ✅ Contact info shows support@nixr.com

**No changes needed** - Legal documents are ready for launch!

### 3. Testing Documentation
**Status**: ✅ Completed

- ✅ Mobile app testing procedures (7 categories)
- ✅ Admin dashboard testing procedures (6 categories)
- ✅ Integration testing guidelines

### 4. Launch Checklist Review
