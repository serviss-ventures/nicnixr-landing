# Community System Improvements - June 7, 2025

## Session Update: Comment Likes & Post Interaction

### New Features Implemented

#### 1. Comment Like Functionality
- Heart button on comments now fully functional
- Toggle between filled/outline heart based on like state
- Like count updates in real-time
- Haptic feedback on like action
- State persists while modal is open
- Both post and modal views update simultaneously

#### 2. Posts Now Clickable to Open Comments
- Clicking anywhere on a post opens the comment modal
- Implemented with TouchableOpacity wrapper
- Action buttons properly isolated with event.stopPropagation():
  - Like button
  - Comment button
  - Share button
  - "Send Love" button (for crisis posts)
- Maintains high touch target area while preserving button functionality
- Better UX - users naturally expect to click posts to see more

### Technical Implementation

#### handleLikeComment Function
```typescript
const handleLikeComment = async (postId: string, commentId: string) => {
  // Haptic feedback
  await Haptics.impactAsync(Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light);
  
  // Update both main posts array and selected post
  // Ensures UI consistency across views
};
```

#### Post Click Handler
```typescript
<TouchableOpacity 
  style={styles.postCard}
  activeOpacity={0.95}
  onPress={() => handleCommentPress(post)}
>
  {/* Post content */}
  {/* Action buttons with event.stopPropagation() */}
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### UX Improvements
- Natural interaction patterns
- Clear visual feedback
- Consistent behavior across the app
- Reduced friction to engage with content
- Better discoverability of comment feature

### Status
✅ Comment likes working perfectly
✅ Post click to open comments implemented
✅ Button isolation prevents accidental triggers
✅ Haptic feedback for all interactions
✅ Code committed and pushed to main

### Notes
- Minor TypeScript warning about navigation type remains (using any)
- Functionality takes precedence over type perfection
- All features tested and working smoothly
