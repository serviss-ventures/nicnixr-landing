# Recovery Journal and Reset Modal Session Summary
Date: January 3, 2025

## Overview
This session focused on fixing UI issues in the Recovery Journal feature and completely redesigning the Reset Progress modal for better UX and functionality.

## Recovery Journal Fixes

### 1. Scale Label Spacing Issue
**Problem**: The "5" label was too close to the scale buttons
**Solution**: Changed `marginBottom` from `SPACING.xs` (4px) to `SPACING.md` (16px) in `RecoveryJournal.tsx`

### 2. Customize Panel Scroll Issue
**Problem**: Info banner was scrolling with content instead of staying fixed
**Solution**: Restructured layout to have fixed header section with ScrollView only for customizable factors

### 3. SafeAreaView Header Issue
**Problem**: Header was positioned behind status bar
**Solution**: Moved SafeAreaView to outermost level of component hierarchy

### 4. Historical Data Support
**Implementation**: Full support for viewing and editing past journal entries with proper state management

## Reset Progress Modal Redesign

### Original Issues
- Compact design had functionality problems
- Money saved wasn't preserved during relapse
- Future dates were allowed
- Poor aesthetics and cramped layout

### New Design Features
1. **Clean One-Screen Layout**
   - Removed ScrollView for better UX
   - Compact, elegant button design
   - Removed info banner to save space

2. **Color-Coded Options**
   - Orange: Relapse (preserves money saved)
   - Red: Fresh Start (resets everything)
   - Green: Date Correction (recalculates timeline)

3. **Improved Functionality**
   - Added `maximumDate={new Date()}` to prevent future dates
   - Fixed money saved preservation using `updateStats` action
   - Dynamic button text and icons based on selection

4. **UI Enhancements**
   - Smaller Cancel and action buttons
   - Reduced spacing throughout
   - Better visual hierarchy
   - Consistent dark theme

## Technical Implementation

### Key Components Modified
- `mobile-app/src/components/dashboard/RecoveryJournal.tsx`
- `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/ResetProgressModal.tsx`

### State Management
- Redux progressSlice for data persistence
- AsyncStorage for journal entries (date-based keys)
- Proper action dispatching for different reset types

### UI/UX Improvements
- Haptic feedback for user interactions
- Linear gradients for visual appeal
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Accessibility considerations

## Testing Notes
- Tested on physical iPhone (simulator has persistent issues)
- Using Expo tunnel for development due to hotel WiFi restrictions
- All functionality verified working correctly

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding data export functionality for journal entries
- Potential for adding more customizable tracking factors
- Could implement data visualization for tracked metrics
