# Dashboard Redesign Session Summary

## Date: January 6, 2025

### Overview
Redesigned the dashboard's "Quick Actions" section to be more user-friendly and intuitive for new users.

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. **Renamed Section for Clarity**
- Changed from "Quick Actions" → "Today's Recovery Tools"
- More descriptive and tells users exactly what these are and when to use them

#### 2. **Reorganized Layout**
- **Primary CTA**: "Daily Check-in" (was "Recovery Journal")
  - Added time estimate: "2 min • How are you feeling today?"
  - Changed icon from book to pencil (create action)
  - Made it the most prominent action

- **Support Tools Row**: Three equal-sized cards
  - "Get Guidance" (was "AI Coach") - "AI coach available 24/7"
  - "Your Plan" (was "My Plan") - "Week 1 activities"
  - "Today's Tip" - "Quick motivation"

- **Settings Link**: Subtle link at bottom
  - "Need to update your quit date?" instead of prominent "Reset Date" button

#### 3. **Visual Improvements**
- Fixed card heights to be uniform (110px)
- Removed unnecessary "NEW" badge
- Reduced bottom padding to minimize empty space
- Tightened up spacing between elements

#### 4. **UX Enhancements**
- Clear value propositions for each tool
- Time expectations set ("2 min", "Quick motivation")
- Availability noted ("24/7")
- More conversational, encouraging language

### Technical Details
- All changes in `mobile-app/src/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.tsx`
- Added new styles for support tools layout
- Maintained navigation functionality to AI Coach and Recovery Plans screens
- Fixed TypeScript issues with userProfile prop

### Result
A much cleaner, more intuitive dashboard that immediately communicates to new users:
- What they can do
- Why they should do it
- How long it will take
- When it's available

The layout is now balanced, engaging, and drives users toward their daily check-in while making other tools easily accessible.
