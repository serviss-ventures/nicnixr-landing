# Progress Screen Design Update Session Summary

## 📅 Session Date: January 29, 2025

## 🎯 **Objective**
Update the Progress screen design to match the unified design system established in the community and profile screen redesigns, while preserving all critical recovery tracking logic and functionality.

## 🚨 **Issue Identified**
The Progress screen had inconsistent styling compared to the newly redesigned community and profile screens, using different colors, tab navigation styles, and layout patterns that created visual discord when switching between tabs.

## ❌ **Before (Issues)**
- **Inconsistent color scheme** - Used cyan, purple, and other colors not aligned with brand
- **Different gradient background** - Dark blue gradient instead of brand gradient
- **Old tab navigation style** - Different from pill-style tabs in other screens
- **Inconsistent typography** - Different font sizes and spacing
- **Poor visual hierarchy** - Cards and components looked different from other screens
- **Mixed styling patterns** - No unified design language

## ✅ **After (Solutions Implemented)**

### **🎨 Color Scheme Unification**
- **Updated all recovery phases** to use `COLORS.primary` and `COLORS.secondary`
- **Biological systems colors** standardized to brand colors
- **Benefits categories** updated to consistent green palette
- **Removed hard-coded colors** (#00FFFF, #8B5CF6, #EF4444, etc.)
- **Consistent icon and accent colors** throughout

### **🏗️ Layout & Structure Improvements**
- **SafeAreaView restructure** to match community and profile screens
