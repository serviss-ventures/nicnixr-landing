**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Time**: 10:45 PM PST
**Commit**: 776f764

## Summary
Successfully cleaned up the onboarding screen based on user feedback that it looked too much like a "love therapist app" rather than a serious nicotine cessation tool.

## Changes Made
1. **Removed Floating Blobs**: No more animated background circles
2. **Changed Heart to Shield**: Shield-checkmark icon for serious health focus
3. **Removed All Dark Blurs**:
   - No glassmorphism effects
   - No gradient fades
   - Clean transparent backgrounds
4. **Professional Features**:
   - "Data-Driven" with analytics icon
   - "Health Focused" with fitness icon
   - "Science-Backed" with trending icon
5. **Simplified Design**: Removed emojis and overly emotional language

## Result
Clean, professional onboarding appropriate for a nicotine crushing app. No more romantic vibes - just focused recovery support.

## Safe to Deploy
This version has been tested and is working correctly. All unnecessary visual effects have been removed while maintaining the core functionality.
