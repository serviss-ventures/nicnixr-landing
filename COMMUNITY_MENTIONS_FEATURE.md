# Community @Mentions Feature

## Date: June 7, 2025

## Overview
Added @mention functionality to the community comment system, allowing users to tag each other in comments for better engagement and targeted conversations.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Mention Detection
- Detects when user types "@" in comment input
- Shows suggestions after @ symbol
- Filters suggestions based on typed characters
- Supports names with spaces and initials (e.g., "Sarah M.")

### 2. Mention Suggestions UI
- Horizontal scrollable list appears above input
- Shows up to 5 matching users
- Each suggestion displays:
  - User avatar with badge
  - Username
- Purple theme consistent with app design
- Tap to insert mention

### 3. Mention Display
- @mentions highlighted in purple (#8B5CF6)
- Bold font weight for visibility
- Works with various name formats
- Properly parsed in rendered comments

### 4. User Sources
- Current user
- Post authors
- Comment authors  
- Connected buddies
- No duplicates (uses Map for uniqueness)

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [showMentions, setShowMentions] = useState(false);
const [mentionSearch, setMentionSearch] = useState('');
const [mentionStartIndex, setMentionStartIndex] = useState(-1);
```

### Key Functions
- `getAllUsers()` - Aggregates all mentionable users
- `handleCommentTextChange()` - Detects @ and manages suggestions
- `selectMention()` - Inserts selected mention into text
- `renderCommentContent()` - Parses and highlights mentions

### Regex Pattern
```typescript
/@([A-Za-z]+(?:\s+[A-Za-z]\.?)?)/g
```
Captures:
- Single names: @Sarah
- Names with initials: @Sarah M.
- Full names: @Emma L

## Example Usage
Included mock comment demonstrating mentions:
> "@Emma L. is right! I was at a similar party last week. Step outside and call someone. @Anonymous you've got this! The community is here for you 24/7"

## UI/UX Considerations
- Haptic feedback on mention selection
- Keyboard stays open during selection
- Suggestions persist until space after @
- Clean, non-intrusive design
- Fast filtering for smooth experience

## Future Enhancements
- Notification when mentioned
- Tap mention to view profile
- Backend integration for mention notifications
- @ symbol highlighting while typing
- Auto-complete with arrow keys
- Mention everyone with @all or @here
